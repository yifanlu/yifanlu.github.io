Another demo of the powers of Josh (and the ASCIIMan engine). Really simple game of Pong, based on the code for ASCIIMan (stripped down and modified). Controls are 'W' and 'Z' for player 1, 'I' and 'M' for player 2.

**Temporary fix for "invalid memory access" errors**

Until I have time to fix it, here's a temporary fix.





  1. Download [DLLs](http://github.com/downloads/yifanlu/Josh/Josh_libraries.zip).


  2. Choose the DLL file that corresponds to your Windows version.


  3. Rename that DLL to "JoshCore.dll"


  4. Move that file to your temp folder (Type: %temp% in the address bar)
