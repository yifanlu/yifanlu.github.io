This script will listen for FaceTime calls every minute. If it finds one, it will auto-accept the call and mute the system. Once the call ends, it will kill FaceTime (so the camera doesn't stay on) and turn the volume back on. This is great for allowing you to always check your Mac's camera when you are away with a simple FaceTime call.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your OSX's FaceTime email is secret, or random people can call you.

If you want to run this in the background and on startup, download [iBackground Scripts](http://www.tomx-applescripts.hostzi.com/iBackgroundScripts.zip), save the script as an application, and run iBackground Scripts on it. Then you can set the application as startup.
