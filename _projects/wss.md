This is an ajax word search solver. The user inputs a word search puzzle. Then, the user can enter the word he/she is looking for, and live on the page, (if found), the word will be highlighted on the puzzle as the user is typing. The actual puzzle-solving algorithm is in PHP. I know this is inefficient, but I just wanted to try out JSON. Features include inputing one word at a time, inputing a word list, adding word with enter, removing word by highlighting the word in the select box and pressing the "delete" key or double clicking.
