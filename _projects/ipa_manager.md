Manages, download, update, and install cracked iPhone/iPod Touch IPA apps.



**Features**  

*Gathers data from online iPhone app cracking sites  

*List view and icons view  

*Details about apps  

*Stats about your downloading habits (in the about screen)  

*Auto-backup database in case of corruption  

*Saves all settings (view, window size, etc)  

*Easy to use  

*Search and filtering  

*Caches data to prevent stealing too much bandwith





**Known Bugs**  

Uses alot of memory (I don't know how to do the icons without ImageList cacheing over 9000 icons into your memory)





**Other Infomation**  

I know the file is kinda fig (80MB), but it includes the complete database as of 12/23/08 with all the icons, cache, infomation, etc so you don't have to download it from the source's site. If you want, you can get the lite version [here](http://rapidshare.com/files/175990098/ipa_manager_2_0_lite.exe) which is the barebone software.
