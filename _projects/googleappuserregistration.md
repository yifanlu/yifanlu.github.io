This piece of code is in two parts:

1. The backend is a PHP class that scrapes Google Apps' pages and allows creating of accounts by sending POST requests to Google's servers.
2. The frontend is a clone of the Gmail/Google Accounts registration page. However, the frontend can be easily coded by you to fit your custom registration pages.
