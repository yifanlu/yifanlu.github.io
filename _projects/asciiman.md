This was my final project in my Computer Science class. I decided to do something nobody (in my knowledge) in the world has done. Write a working animated ASCII game in Windows Console with Java. Using Josh, this is a complete game engine with sound, graphics, physics, collision, etc. There is only a test level, because I'm not a level designer and I ran out of time, I hope someone can take this engine and make a complete game or something.

**Temporary fix for "invalid memory access" errors**

Until I have time to fix it, here's a temporary fix.





  1. Download [DLLs](http://github.com/downloads/yifanlu/Josh/Josh_libraries.zip).


  2. Choose the DLL file that corresponds to your Windows version.


  3. Rename that DLL to "JoshCore.dll"


  4. Move that file to your temp folder (Type: %temp% in the address bar)
