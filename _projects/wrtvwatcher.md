Sets sliently on the desktop looking for an item to be in stock at WRTV. WRTV gives you free stuff when you have enough points, but most of the good stuff are always sold out, so I wrote this program to notify me when an item gets in stock. After running this program nonstop every 5 minutes for a whole year, I concluded WRTV is a scam, and this program is useless.
