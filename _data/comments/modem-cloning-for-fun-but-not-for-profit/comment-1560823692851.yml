  considering what your article reveals about DOCSIS encryption it does make me
  slightly more paranoid considering the Security is lax and it's possible to
  MITM attack  people's traffic and analyzing it even though MOST of the article
  flew over the head of my level of technological knowledge I am able to gleam
  enough technical understanding of it to realize  for all the modems on my CMT
  with SNMP enabled it should be possible to essentially sniff their traffic and
  launch a rainbow tables decryption algorithm on it and if it's THAT Simple for
  anyone with the technological means to do so it makes me that much more
  paranoid and wanting to use my Private paid for VPN more often because god
  only knows what my neighbors are capable of and I don't like being spied on or
  to think it would be THAT easy to figure out what websites I visit and what
  I'm doing.
