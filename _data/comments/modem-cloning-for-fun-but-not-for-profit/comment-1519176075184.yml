message: "I've been developing software for over 25 years. My ISP refuses to let me purchase my own DOCSIS modem and I MUST use their piece of S#IT (POS). I was searching for a way of spoofing the MAC Addr so that I could use my own modem. \r\nEven with the 25+ years of software dev what you describe sounds like fun but not simple (not for an old dog like myself anyway). I was hoping for a silver bullet. I've tried to ssh into the POS modem but it's locked down pretty well (probably a result of safeguards against the rabbit hole of modem cloning, etc.)\r\nThanks for the entertaining blog post and a trip back down memory lane back when 4K was considered a lot of memory."
