message: "This article is excellent, but at the same time, showede how \"out of my league\" is all this procedure.\r\n\r\nAs others posted here, I'm stuck with an old cable modem with DOCSIS 2.0 on it. It's a good device, but the outdated firmware is giving me hard times with my connection because of the new ways of transmitting the signal.\r\n\r\nThe tech support is a nightmare here and they can let you down in several ways before solving something.\r\n\r\nA lot of times I finally solved the problems on my own.\r\n\r\nI wanted, as the article explains, use a new cable modem with my service.\r\n\r\nI PAY for it, so I wish it could be like in other countries where you can use whatever you want and they have their controls of the service on the end of their line, no both ways.\r\n\r\nSo I was about to buy a used cable modem of someone that was client of the same company, but I called them first and they wouldn't allow me to use other modem (providing the new MAC of course) because of legal issues regarding the contract of the user and the cable modem that the ISP provides to that user, specifically.\r\n\r\nNow that I see this article I realize that I don't have the technical knowledge to achieve this. I was hopping to find some firmware replacement that allowed me to change the MAC with mine and achieve somehow the synchronization with the ISP.\r\n\r\nBut finally seeing what needs to be done... I will need to fight this with tech support this time.\r\n\r\nThe \"third way\" is too difficult for me in this one. :(\r\n\r\nTHANKS anyway for this awesome article. Very useful!"
