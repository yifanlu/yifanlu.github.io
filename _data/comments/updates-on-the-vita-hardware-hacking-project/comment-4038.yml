message: Don't give up and continue your good job. I heard somewhere the PS Vita use
  a NetBSD operating system and not a Linux anymore like the PSP. Maybe you should
  try to mount it on a BSD operating system like freebsd or PC-BSD for the easy install.
  You could get more chance to mount the file system to be able to dump it. Sorry
  i am noobz with hardware if it something else.
