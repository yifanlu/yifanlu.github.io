message: "&gt; I thought it would be a fun project to practice my hardware design skills even though the end product would not be too useful (the VitaTV already exists).\r\n\r\nMan, HDMI-out is all I ever wanted on a handheld Vita, it's all about having it all on a single system. The VitaTV was a flawed compromise. I'd happily drop cash on a mod if it was proven to work on unhacked Vitas.\r\n\r\nGlad to see attempts on this, even if you choose not to pursue it. Hopefully it gets the ball rolling."
