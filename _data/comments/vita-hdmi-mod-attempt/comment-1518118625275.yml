  I love you for trying this as well as for everything else you've done for Vita
  owners. I am wondering if you could use the headphone jack, along with a 3.5mm
  M2M auxiliary cable for sound. Of course it would be ideal to get the sound
  from the HDMI cable since it's capable, but having this as a work around
  wouldn't be a bad compromise imo.
