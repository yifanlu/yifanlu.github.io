message: I already have an account on the site, but im just able to install the PSM
  Dev For Unity and I already installed on my vita. Do I need the Dev Assistant as
  well? If yes I got the app on my Mac, but I don't know if I can transfer from my
  PC to my vita or find another way to install now that I already have an account
  on the site.. ?
