message: Yifan Lu, any chance of possibility for Rejuvenate to work with p12/krng/seed
  obtained "elsewhere"? Even though I managed to stuff the PSM assistant on a pair
  of 3.18+3.51 yesterday, and it worked, Sony never accepted published key requests
  from my country (among many others), so I had to go elsewhere, and, obviously, the
  daily "call back home" routine won't work... I definitely have witnessed workarounds
  for the daily routine, and looks like they still work on 3.51. I guess a similar
  workaround is a basis for the PSM+?
