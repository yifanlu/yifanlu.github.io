message: 'If anyone interested, the method I used for 3.18 was actually without using
  charles proxy or whatever similar. I just copied the psm dev from a 3.51 to a ps3
  via content manager, then copied it back to 3.18, obviously it started screaming
  that it needs to be updated (no way with 3.18), then transferred some psm assistant
  pkgs to 3.18 via the same ps3 -- they are drm-less as it seems. Probably copying
  the assistant from 3.51 was unnecessary and the packages themselves would suffice,
  don''t know, can try that when the laziness subsides.


  The package names I transferred are these, you can try yourself on a 3.18, they
  are perfectly googleable:


  IP9100-PCSI00007_00-PSSUITEDEV000000.pkg (8286112 bytes)

  IP9100-PCSI00007_00-PSSUITEDEV000000-A0114-V0100-29622fe379594b215a038ed988c7c53958df33a0-PE.pkg
  (16871424 bytes)


  ...in that particular order. I just installed them on a cfw ps3 via the package
  manager, and copied them over to vita. The list about is probably redundant, you
  probably can throw away one of them w/o consequences -- not sure about that, just
  loaded them both just in case.


  IP9100-PCSI00011_00-PSMRUNTIME000000-A0200-V0100* (the v2 runtime), on the other
  hand, seems to be DRM-protected -- copying that over didn''t work.'
