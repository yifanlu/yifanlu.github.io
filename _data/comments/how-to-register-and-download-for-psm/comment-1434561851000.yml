  However while transfer the PSM Dev app to the Vita, I got this message on the vita


  "The content has expired or the owner of the content is another player"


  Searching in the forum , some person stated that PSM Dev app should be in your download
  list (automatically added after PSM Developer registration) in order to transfer
  it from your ps3.


  So it seems like now if you could not register as PSM Dev, there is no way to get
  it :(


  can someone confirm if there is another way or if I am wrong?'
