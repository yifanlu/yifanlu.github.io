message: 'Without reversing it, probably they just patch the kernel memory with a
  testkit/devkit memory portion memory to enable fake selfs. That might explain why
  now core dumps from a testkit works on a retail console. I''m assuming this, because
  if i were one of the security experts, that Sony hired while developing the console,
  the first thing i would suggest is they to completely remove all the unused dev/debug
  routines available on the retail console, in that way an attacker can''t use any
  dev/debug routine floating in the binary image.

  I really hope they (molecule team) didn''t exploit the TEE (I''m saying that due
  the "Stage 3 encrypted" binary that KoriTama hinted...) and I really hope that Sony
  used TEE for the keys in a crypto context...'
