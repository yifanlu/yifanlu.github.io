message: Do you know of anyone that can work on the Unity version?It seems like it
  could end up being very popular since lots of people couldn't get the normal version.Besides
  that, it supports Unity so possibly (don't know anything about this) people can
  make games like the VHBL Call of Duty Zombies.It never seemed that popular for developers
  but aren't there advantages to having it vs not?
