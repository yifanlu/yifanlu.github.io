message: i was in the same boat as cypherous1 but i got my ps vita and it updated
  before i realized what was needed to hack the system.  hopefully one day there will
  be another way around the 3.52 version whether it be a firmware downgrade or just
  another way all together to put cfw on it.  oh well for now i guess... :(
