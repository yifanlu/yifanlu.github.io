message: Any update on this hack? I keep getting a U007 error when I try to install
  it. I have version 3.1 on my Kindle. I'm trying to enable SSH access eventually,
  but I have not been able to successfully install this hack nor a usbnetwork hack.
  I've been using a few of the mobileread forums for instructions. Any input would
  be great.
