message: Its interesting to note that there are people who are worried about how amazon
  is making profits. I'm not worried at all and if anyone would like to donate some
  of their pirated book collection to me they are welcome to do so, I'm a pauper compared
  to the mighty amazon and I have no qualms about not buying books from them after
  having been tempted to buy the kindle :)
