message: 'After fubaring my UK wifi Kindle I gratefully received another (a day later!)
  only to discover I couldn''t get rid of the dead poets'' society in the screensavers,
  yup 3.2.1 but not ad driven. Your jailbreak resolved that (thanks and kudos in equal
  and large but indeterminate amounts). But...


  Not a great problem, but when sorted by collections the kindle used to show (even
  in vanilla) the most recent books first, but no longer. Slightly annoying trying
  to find the last book. Is it an effect of the 3.2.1 jailbreak or the large-ish amounts
  of txt non-drm books I have?


  Still, thanks much for your inordinately helpful efforts.'
