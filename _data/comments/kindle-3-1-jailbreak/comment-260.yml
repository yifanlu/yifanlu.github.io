message: 'Yup, I''ve seen torrents titled "the top 1000 amazon kindle books mobi"
  floating around the internet with plenty of seeds/peers. I''ve never had the heart
  to take one though, because Amazon barely (if at all) makes any profits from the
  Kindle hardware itself. The company is relying on the fact that users will buy books
  from them; that is where they will profit. It''s just like printers: sell the printer
  cheap (often for under $20 if you buy it with a new computer) but make the ink super
  expensive. Except Amazon is less evil and sells most ebooks at a reasonable price
