message: It's possible to use the kindle to redirect the usbnetwork to wifi adhoc
  host. However, you need to compile a custom kernel with bridge and/or iptables masquerade
  enabled. It is also possible to set the wifi chip into master (router) mode. It's
  a bit complicated, and I may write about it one day. For now, I'm afraid you can
  research this on your own.
