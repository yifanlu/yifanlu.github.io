message: Nope, I think Amazon secretly doesn't care for jailbreaks and such. Because
  on iPhone, PS3, etc, the main problem with unsigned code is piracy, but on the Kindle
  1) there are hardly any pirated ebooks and most of which are in PDF (hard to read)
  or ePub. And 2) People can already read drm-free books without jailbreaking. The
  only reason to block jailbreaks is so users don't do anything stupid and call amazon
  for support.
