message: 'The jailbreak hurts no one.  It adds features for users, hasn''t lost Amazon
  any money, and - most importantly - doesn''t (currently) facilitate piracy.  Kindle''s
  open nature means you can get books from anywhere in any format, convert them, and
  view them.  That''s by design.


  The undiscovered country here is .azw2 files - Kindle Apps.  Those CANNOT be obtained
  through means other than Amazon directly.  Amazon will not care about jailbreaks
  until someone figures how to pirate those.'
