message: "Well, If I recall the Vita has an eMMC it should not be to difficult to\
  \ produce an exploit for it. I know RAM dumps are not possible for the vita because\
  \ it shares the same board as the other components.\nLooking back on Yifan's other\
  \ posts, dumping a vita game is very possible to find an exploit. I mean you could\
  \ dump the contents of the game and share it with some of the other vita developers/hackers\
  \ to try to find an exploit. Then someone would have to find a way to dump the modification\
  \ back onto the cartridge and see what happens.\nIt is sort of how the PSP was hacked.\n\
  The only flaws in this method is that it would be rather inconvenient for anyone\
  \ who just wanted to play a SNES emulator on there vita because they would have\
  \ knowledge and the tools to do what I have described. \nMaybe sometime in the near\
  \ future there maybe a PSvita cartridge reader to make whole process easier. But,\
  \ I do have my doubts. Oh well ^_^"
