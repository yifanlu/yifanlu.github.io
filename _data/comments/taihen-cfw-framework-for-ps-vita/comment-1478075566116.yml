message: "This sounds awesome, I can't even imagine the extent of the possibilities, You've got me super hyped right now!\r\n\r\nOn a related note, When you released Henkaku, I was excited, but I honestly didn't think there'd be enough devs on board to build a healthy homebrew scene. Already, we've seen so many homebrew, and there's more to come - and now we have this! Thank you guys so much! :)"
