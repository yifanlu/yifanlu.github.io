message: Hi yifan i know that you are not interested in KOALA's work but i think it
  is possible to run homebrew with his work (trigger a exploit) OR install PKG files
  as it does not require PSN account (http://www.ps3news.com/psp-ps-vita-news/video-ps-vita-proof-of-concept-installing-pkg-games-apps-demo/)
  and some hackers found way to open PKG installer on vita i think with a little help
  from u koala can hack vita.I know you are looking to do things in different way
  (run unsigned code) but hay give it a short.Plz make a post about vita NAND decryption
