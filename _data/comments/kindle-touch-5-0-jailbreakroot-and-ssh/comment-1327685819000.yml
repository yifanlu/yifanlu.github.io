message: 'So, correct me if I''m wrong, but I just want to clarify; when you have
  a computer that is connected to the internet, with the usbnet ssh hack you can plug
  the Kindle into the computer and get a connection through the usb cord? If so, wouldn''t
  that be much slower?


  A similar question, enterprise and peer-to-peer networks. Is there any way to connect
  to those? Would that be how the usbnet ssh hack is used?


  Thanks, and sorry for the load of questions'
