  i copied the mp3 to the music. clicked the jaibreak button, saw the jaibreak in
  progress screen, had the screensaver  and that all.. even if i waited 1 hour or
  tried multiples times.

  preharps i should try from a hard reset i.e. erase all and retry. any suggestion
  ?


  by the way, how to compile the sources ? I can try without the screensaver line.'
