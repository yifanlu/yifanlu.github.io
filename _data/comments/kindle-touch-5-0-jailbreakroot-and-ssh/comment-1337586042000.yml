  But I did that already many times :

  - my KT doesn''t reacte more

  - it acts like ignoring the RUNME.sh

  I''ve already try to copy KT''slogfiles tu /mnt/us to see what''s happening, with
  no result

  And I got attention with the case sensitive of the RUNME.sh file

  The only way to access my KT is using Mfgtool to put it in Fast/Diags/Normal Mode


  Any other idea ?'
