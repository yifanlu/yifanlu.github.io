message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old \r\ndaughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched \r\nher ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!"
