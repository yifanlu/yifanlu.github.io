  "But after running one of the tests (I ran a few without checking so I don''t know
  which one exactly) the xml is created and you can exit diagnostics. If you want,
  I can enter diagnostics and try the tests one by one to see which one creates the
  file.


  I also deleted the ENABLE_DIAGS file in USB mode while experimenting how to disable
  diagnostics but I believe that is optional.
