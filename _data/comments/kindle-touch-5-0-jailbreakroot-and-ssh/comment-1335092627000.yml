message: "Hi, your jailbreak worked perfectly for my Kindle 4NT. Thanks.\nNow I'm\
  \ trying to install the usbnetwork util. Though the Kindle 'UPDATED' fine, I cant\
  \ seem to ssh or use the ; commands from the kindle... was that meant only for the\
  \ Touch, or will it work for the K4 as well? \nThanks."
