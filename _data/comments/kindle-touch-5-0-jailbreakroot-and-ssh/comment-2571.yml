  I just used the 5.0.3 jailbreak on my new KT and I''m now trying to use the usbnetwork
  to get my hands on an ssh session. I followed the readme filebut when it says "The
  IP for the Kindle will always be 192.168.15.244", well I just couldn''t ping any
  device on that IP. So what I checked out the logs on my wifi router and discovered
  that my dhcp gave the kindle the ip 192.168.1.2 (the .1 being my router and the
  kindle being the only device actually connected). So I went on doing the ;un password
  myrootpassword and tried an ssh root@192.168.1.2 but the ssh server keeps telling
  me "Permission denied" when I enter myrootpassword...


  Am I doing it wrong ?'
