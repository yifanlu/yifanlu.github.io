message: 'Hello


  I''ve tried the jailbreak using the data.tar.gz file that I''ve copied at root''s
  Kindle

  After rebooting, the jailbreak''s process was going on, but last very much

  After 1 hour, no change in the progress bar

  I turn my KT off and since that moment, it always go on reboot without any error
  message


  Using hard reset don''t work

  Using diags mode allows me to access KT in USB mode


  I''ve tried again the data.tar.gz jailbreak, but it doesn''t work any more.

  Idem for trying to uninstall jailbreak using update_jailbreak_1.1_k5_uninstall.bin


  No result, my KT keeps on rebooting


  Have you some idea to reset my KT or anything else so I can use it again


  Thanks'
