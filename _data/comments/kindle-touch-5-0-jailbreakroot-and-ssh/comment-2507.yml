message: Hi Yifan, thanks for your work. I installed jailbraker and launcher to be
  able to rotate to landscape view.  all is working great. I realise however that
  my wi-fi is no longer working since.  I have a network and password, but while it
  finds the network, the password is not accepted as valid, hence I remain disconnected.
  Could this be attributed to the install I did? Any idea how to fix it?
