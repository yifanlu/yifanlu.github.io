  is there a way to undo this??

  Tried rebooting.

  Displays screensaver, but when I wake it up the screensaver remains

  on the screen with only the menu bar appearing.

  The menu bar does absolutely nothing.

  Pressing the home button causes the loading icon in the top left to spin and the
  page refreshes but nothing happens.'
