message: "Would this jailbreak allow me to use my Kindle Touch as a PDA to store my\
  \ 3000+ addresses and calendar entries? \n\nI think the potential of the Kindle\
  \ as a simple business \"Rolodex\" machine has been oversighted. The fantastic screen,\
  \ the lightning fast boot time, the phenomenal battery life, the simple (almost\
  \ crash-free) operating system, could make it the #1 PDA, even it had to be read-only.\n\
  \nCurrently, I am able to convert my contacts into .txt and read them as a book\
  \ on the Kindle; but the search function makes it impossible to find anything. Converting\
  \ into an ebook via Calibre doesn't help.\n\nI wasn't able to read my calendar in\
  \ html or csv or ical either - at least not in a usable way."
