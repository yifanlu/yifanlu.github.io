  I know it''s been a little while, but if you''re still having the problem, maybe
  this can help.


  I had the exact same issue. Once you''ve done everything you need to in Diags Mode,
  hook your kindle up to your computer (I believe there''s an option in the Diags
  menu to have it act as a USB.)

  Simply delete the .txt that you used to set it to Diags Mode in the first place.
  Restart your kindle, and voila.'
