message: Thank for all your information... I'm not a tech expert by any means but
  this has helped a lot.  I was wondering, I just today made the upgrade to 5.0.3
  and it required me to move a file directly to the "root"? not within any folders.  Is
  there a way to downgrade to 5.0.1? How would I go about this?  Thank you!
