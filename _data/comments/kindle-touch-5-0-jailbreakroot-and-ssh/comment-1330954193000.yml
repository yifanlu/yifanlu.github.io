message: Hi! your modification worked perfectly on my Kindle touch but I'm trying
  to customize screensavers on my kindle 4.0.1 now and was wondering if the simple
  custom screensaver mod works on it. I can't seem to get it to but that is after
  uninstalling it a few times and accidently installing the touch mod on it first
  so I'm thinking of restoring factory settings and trying from scratch again but
  am wondering if it works at all? I follwed the three essential steps and everything
  but no luck :(
