message: 'In my opinion one of the most important options the kindle doesn´t have
  is the possibility to create subfolders, or to exchange folders via your explorer
  directly (and keep the folders on your kindle)...

  Is there a way to do that? Any USB Stick can do that, why doesn´t the Kindle?

  I have to arrange about 400 PDF Files and with the ordinary "collections" it absolutely
  doesn´t work...

  Thanks for any help!


  I know this is no Kindle Touch Forum for ordinary questions, but i thought i might
  just ask the developers :)'
