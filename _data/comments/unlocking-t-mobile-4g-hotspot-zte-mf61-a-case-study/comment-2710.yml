message: 'I followed what you are doing since the kindle touch MP3 hack. This guide
  is just amazing and I might try to hack a bit, with this help, myself. I found stripped
  down (Laptop) BIOSes/EFIs an interesting target.

  Anyway, I just wanted to leave you this little note, that I appreciate your work
  a lot. Thank you.'
