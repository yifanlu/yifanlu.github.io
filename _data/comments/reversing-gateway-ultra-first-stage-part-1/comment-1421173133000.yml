message: 'Hello Yifan, though I don''t know about codes, but will these be the start
  of free 3DS CFW?



  I have a 3DS 4.5FW and I am planning to buy their gateway just to play imports and
  preserve the lower firmware for homebrew..



  If this should really happen, we can eliminate these money-grabbing gateway and
  enjoy hacking community as it should be..



  More power to you Yifan Lu!!'
