message: Well the situation is quite clear. Vita is one hard piece to crack. The time
  has come for the PS Vita slim model to be announced and (we can already call it
  this way) the Vita PHAT still hasnt been natively hacked. (except the VHBL PSP stuff).
  Maybe Sony did some hardware modification to the Slim model aka stupid mistakes
  and we might get lucky and crack it? i hope so! Vita Slim or shall we call it the
  low budget version? will be released on 10th October in Japan. Release the hackers!!
