message: "I bought my first PSP (3000) 8 years ago, and when I found out that it was possible to \"jailbreak\" it like the Iphone. I was very happy because at the time, PSP was a marvelous console, and it had a such a good reputation.  Running my favourite homebrews on the go was pretty cool, as well as customizing it by installing plugins. Sadly, my PSP died couple years ago and I lost interest. But until a week ago, when I stumbled upon your website and found out that it was possible to run homebrews and ePSP on the Vita, I had the urge to buy a PS Vita 3.60 to relive memories of the past. \r\n\r\nThe days of PSP hacking community were glorious. I'll never forget those days."
