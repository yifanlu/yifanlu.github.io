message: 'FYI, the first Wii hack wasn''t quite a hardware RAM dumper - it was a software
  RAM dumper running in the (insecure) Gamecube mode, plus a hardware glitch (shorting
  out address pins) to get access to RAM that you normally wouldn''t have access to
  from Gamecube mode. Same as the first PS3 hack: shorting out a RAM line to produce
  a random glitch that  (preventing a write to the page table) puts the hypervisor
  memory protection model into an inconsistent state that could be abused to break
  out of the Other OS sandbox. Both of those require access to the RAM pins (and unhashed/insecure
  RAM) but do not require a full hardware sniffer/injector, which would be orders
  of magnitude harder to design/use.


  OTOH, the Wii U exploits didn''t require any hardware tricks, mostly due to similarities
  to the Wii and other devices.'
