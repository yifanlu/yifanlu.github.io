message: Yifan.lu I LOVE YOU HAVE MY BABY...all joking aside, I'm a dude so yeah can't
  bear children, awesome write up.  I followed you back during your Touch days, got
  it mostly because of you because I wanted the touch but I wanted to load my own
  pictures for the screensaver. When I saw you jailbroke it, I went ahead and got
  one, and being the nondouchebag that I am got the no ads 3g one, because I know
  there are a few that got the ad one and disabled that; that's like playing downloaded
  games on the vita in my mind, just tsk tsk.
