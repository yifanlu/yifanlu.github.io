message: 'I''m thinking about several approaches to get to the kernel. For example
  - ps4. I''m almost certain it will be hacked at some point because of it''s architecture
  similarities with a common pc. I''m wondering about the skype/browser approach.
  Always wondered what happens when you call from psp (inside the vita) to another
  vita. Skype is a well known program on pc, x360, psp and vita. There must be some
  similarities between them.

  About the browser - it''s javascript capable. What if somebody created a virus/sniffer
  to see inside the vita through the browser.

  The last one that bothers my mind is a hardware hack to temporarily shortcut vita
  to cause error in reading/writing and hijack a key vault. Possibly could be done
  during the backup process via usb.


  Your thoughts?'
