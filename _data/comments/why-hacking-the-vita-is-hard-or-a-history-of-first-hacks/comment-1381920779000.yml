message: The only hope for a (near the future) vita hack is some kind of sdk leak
  or something.. or a big team with the apropriate tools to make an hardware hack..
  but for those kind of "companies" there must be a way to make money out of this..
  like a dongle or something so.. again i don't see that coming soon.. :(
