message: After you install the package from Cydia, Ezie, you can use the internet
  through EDGE (if all goes right). Just disable Wifi and see if internet works. If
  not, install my configuration bundle linked above and try again. And the proxy is
  running on your phone. It's a Python proxy (Tiny HTTP Proxy) modified to add "tmobile"
  to all URLs. Since it's not an external proxy, you won't lose any speed.
