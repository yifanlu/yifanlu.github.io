message: 'just tested with ICS again and the proxy does work but the automatic setting
  of the APN is broken.  Normally when proxy is started, it will automatically set
  the correct proxy settings in APN and then when proxy is stopped, it will reset
  APN proxy settings back to stock.  That part is broken in ICS.


  to clement:  most likely, the proxy is running perfectly on your phone.  But your
  imei triggers the tmo firewall to block transmissions.  Only tmo can unblock that
  and the only way I know is to pay tmo.  and when you stop paying, your imei will
  be blocked again.'
