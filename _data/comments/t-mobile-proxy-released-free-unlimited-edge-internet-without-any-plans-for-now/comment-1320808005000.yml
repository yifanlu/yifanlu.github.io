message: 'Thanx Yifan, I have been working on getting an http tunnel going :)


  I set up a squid proxy http server on my desktop. I downloaded connect.c and amusing
  that in conjunction with ssh to tunnel ssh over http. i have a domain name for my
  ip that includes the word tmobile.


  However, this works over wifi but the connect.c tunnel fails on edge. Would you
  have any idea why?'
