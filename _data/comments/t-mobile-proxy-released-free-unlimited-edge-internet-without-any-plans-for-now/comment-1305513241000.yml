message: "Hey, I just installed your proxy and I must say that you've done an excellent\
  \ job with the proxy. However, there seems to be a tiny hiccup. There are times\
  \ when I enter a URL or use the google search but I am directed to the web2go page.\
  \ However, if I repeat my action the web site loads fine. Why is that? \n\nAnd also,\
  \ is there any way to use your proxy over Android? Just curious."
