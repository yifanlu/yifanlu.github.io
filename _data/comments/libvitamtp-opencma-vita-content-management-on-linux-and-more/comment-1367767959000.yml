message: 'Thank you Yifan yet again for at the very least releasing something related
  to the Vita, but mostly thank you for writing this for a Linux based OS.


  Now while I''m not in any way a developer interested in using these tools, I will
  say that I''m interested if libVitaMTP and OpenCMA could potentially lead to using
  Sony''s "Content Manager" offline, or perhaps a unique "Content Manager" Linux based
  program which has an offline mode to transfer media to [and from?] the Vita without
  being monitored.'
