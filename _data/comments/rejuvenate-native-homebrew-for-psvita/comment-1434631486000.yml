  I already noticed this sentence ''''In addition, the Vita also has the entire PSP
  hardware inside its silicon.'''' the first time reading your post, but I didn''t
  pay too much attention to it then,

  But now I have two questions about this:


  1. Does this mean that the ''''ePSP'''' is indeed not a PSP emulator, but rather
  a built-in PSP inside the Vita casing? I read some speculations about this on wololo''s
  forum quite a while ago, but a confirmation would be great. :)


  2. Why did you mention the PSP hardware in the context of the Vita specs in the
  first place? (does this maybe mean that devs can somehow utilize the power of the
  PSP hardware as well for their homebrews, or did I completely misunderstand this
  part?)


  Sorry, if these are stupid questions. I''m a complete noob, but I''m still interested
  in these things. :)'
