message: 'Kind of bummed that the PS TV isn''t supported for now, but here''s hoping
  that restriction goes away quickly.


  As for homebrews, I''d love to see PPSSPP and Retroarch get ported. Aside from not
  being able to play the games bought from PSN, those two emulators blow Sony''s official
  ones out of the water in terms of functionality and flexibility.'
