message: 'Damn, you should have gotten a spot at E3! Thanks for all your work, Yifan
  Lu and all the developers of the Vita scene for not giving up on the Vita for all
  this time.


  I have a question: Would it be possible to overcome the minimal firmware needed
  for Vita games? Like being able to play new games on old firmwares? Maybe the Vita
  has a whitelist for this too and it can be bypassed using the PS TV method? Just
  speculation, but back to the topic, congrats for reaching this far!'
