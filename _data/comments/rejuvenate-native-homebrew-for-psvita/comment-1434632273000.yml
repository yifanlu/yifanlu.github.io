message: 'Quick question: does the version of PSM Dev Assistant matter? My vita has
  been off PSN for a year, still on firmware 3.01, but I downloaded PSM Dev Assistant
  v1.12 before I took the device online. Will this still work with Rejuvenate, or
  must I have the most recent Dev Assistant, v1.2?'
