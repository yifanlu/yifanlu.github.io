message: "Awesome, so once i've completed witcher 2 (50%) and witcher 3 ill have some\
  \ time to go ahead and start a POC GBC emulator in JS, once i've got that running\
  \ the SDK &amp; scene should have had enough progress and ill start a GB emulator.\
  \  My only question is what else does this give the user from what current PSM apps\
  \ can? Cant we just write PSM apps, use your tools to bypass the checks, and run\
  \ those? What gives this the advantage over them? \n\nThanks"
