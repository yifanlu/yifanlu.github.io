message: It's a very good news for psv. I'm just wondering if the homebrew can support
  Emulator apps (like gba/sfc/psp emulator). You just mentioned the homebrew doesn't
  have permission to run ISOs but you also mentioned that dynamic-recompilation can
  be used for Emulators so I'm really confused.
