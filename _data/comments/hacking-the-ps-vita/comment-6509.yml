message: 'Wow.  Absolutely fascinating insight into the sheer amount of man hours
  needed to hack through the Vita security methods - I never knew there were so many!  Reading
  bytecode and grinding through with the undocumented debugger in order to make a
  working solution, UVLoader taking unresolved API calls and mashing them together
  with the resolved ones to breach the security - pretty sure no Sony engineer ever
  thought of that.  Makes the actual process of getting Rejuvenate running to us end
  users on the homebrew scene seem kinda trivial by comparison after all your hard
  work, but man am I and everyone else using Rejuvenate super grateful.


  Thanks Yifan.'
