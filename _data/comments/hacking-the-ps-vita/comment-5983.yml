message: I'm an IT student and I'm currently studying Java and C. I would love to
  help out with the SDK and other stuff but I don't know where to start. This is a
  great milestone for the vita hacking community and I wish there was something I
  could do to help. I feel bad for those who're just waiting for a hack to come out.
  They don't know how much work you put into this. Great job!
