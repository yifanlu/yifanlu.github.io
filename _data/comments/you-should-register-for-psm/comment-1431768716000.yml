message: '@Chaos Theoretically you may be correct, but your post is so vague that
  it doesn''t matter, there is no specific information included so there is no need

  as if Sony could fix the exploit with a simple observation, though there is something
  that bothers me it seems Sony fixed the exploit by mistake on their SDK 2.0 that''s
  just akward if you ask me(I haven''t seen the latest SDK i guess there are fundamental
  changes on how the SDK interacts with the vita).


  @Yifan Lu

  Will you make a blog post on how you found out the exploit(if there is one :P)*
  and how it works? I believe you will but wanna make sure so i can grab a bucket
  of popcorn while reading.
