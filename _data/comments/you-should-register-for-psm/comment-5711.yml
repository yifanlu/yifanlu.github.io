message: '@NoPatience - You made me chuckle a bit, Good job.


  FYI, I''m not a hacker, I''m a programmer. I have a bit more RE experience than
  most, but not enough to tackle the vita with next to zero info on what the OS even
  is. An exploit is useless without a payload or any idea on what the payload should
  be.


  Anyways, I''ll be more specific at risk of post nuke. CVE-2010-4159. Based on the
  license on Sony''s OSE site, it''s entirely possible this vulnerability is in the
  Mono VM used in PSM1. Then again, I have no clue what format shared libraries are
  in on the vita, so I have absolutely zero clue how to go about testing whether this
  is a possible exploit.'
