message: 'Compiled and executed BallMazeDemo on both PS Vita and Sony Tablet P. I
  notice both PSM Dev assistants remember BallMazeDemo in their starting window, with
  a little difference : Sony Tablet P requires systematically a network access to
  check the license in order to run it. PS Vita accepts to run it without network
  access for around 24 hours, after that it requires it again. I wonder if some ''magic''
  proxy could serve license again once Sony servers will stop serving them...'
