message: I'm interested in the PS section because like a dum***** I didn't applied
  for the PSM license. I thought it was still a paid license... Last time I checked
  it was 2 years ago. But meh, still got my psm developer account, C, C++, C# skills
  and some free time ahead for the next couple of months. I might give it a try.
