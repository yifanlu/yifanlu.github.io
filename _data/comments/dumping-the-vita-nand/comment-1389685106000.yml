message: 'Hey Lu, great work. The 100h was worth it since you learned quite a lot
  in the process.

  Just wanted to throw a quick bone at you:

  For the mistery port, many fellows suspect a service port of some kind, if not,
  it can also be used as an accessory port if I remember right, it provides power.

  As you may already know, there are addons that provide video out by using a capture
  card (internal) and a PC with the decoding software. Many say that the capture card
  follows the same principle as the 3ds capture card and so look out for a chip that
  takes care of encoding and conversion on the PSVita.


  Anyways, that''s all I have for now, please let me know if it is of any use, I can
  find out more if not.

  Good luck and thank you very much for sharing.

  P.S.: I have a slim PSVita as well (OG is 3g) if you need to look at any board revisions
  (not sure if ifixit took it apart) to look at.'
