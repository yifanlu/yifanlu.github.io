message: 'Hi Yifan


  Thank you very much for the guide on "upgrading" a K2 to a K3 and the guide to recovering
  a K2 using the serial port.


  I''ve got a couple of kindles (mainly just ones people have given to me due to being
  broken or them upgrading) and as a result I experiment with them quite a bit.


  I recently ran out of space on my K3''s system partition... so I figured I would
  resize the partition to use more of the user partition. For this I turned to your
  custom recovery kernel; I booted the kindle, held down enter and then at the menu
  pressed alt+e.


  When I plug the kindle into my Ubuntu PC, it doesn''t show up in Gparted. In dmesg
  it says :

  "

  [2198375.769468] scsi35 : usb-storage 1-4:1.0

  [2198376.762335] scsi 35:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Kindle   Internal Storage 0100
  PQ: 0 ANSI: 2

  [2198376.763073] sd 35:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0

  [2198376.771378] sd 35:0:0:0: [sdd] Attached SCSI removable disk

  "


  When I try and access the device directly using Gparted it says "No Medium Found".
  The same is true for dd.


  Any ideas what could be wrong ?


  Thanks :)'
