message: "Hello, \n\nI purchased a Kindle 3G + wifi and took it on an extended holiday.\
  \ It froze after 3 weeks and I couldn't get it working. Trying this I think I made\
  \ things worse and messed it all up. Status now is that I can get it in recovery\
  \ mode and even manage to get in the menu after that (when pressing enter during\
  \ restart). My apple recognises it in usb-mode, but the Kindle seems to be empty.\
  \ No folders, no rootfile, no kernel (?). I think I accidently deleted all. Is there\
  \ anyway to have it reinstalled? \n\nThanks"
