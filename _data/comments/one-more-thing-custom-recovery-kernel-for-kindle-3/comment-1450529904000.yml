message: 'I have a DXG that was on 2.5.8 initially. I have updated to 3.1 and in that
  process I saved the "output" folder content on a couple of safe locations. It contains
  "rootfs.img" (409624 kB) and "update_restore-os.bin" (285429 kB).

  After that I have updated to 3.3 using Amazon update (changed ID bit in the file
  to match my device ID).


  Now all is working. Startup is sluggish, but I am fine with that. My issues is that
  I have a nagging feeling that the actual display resolution might be lowered from
  2.5.8. I have a pdf file with graphics and the small text it looks "broken", but
  I don''t have a picture of hot it looked before.

  USB Network doesn''t seem to work on my DXG.


  How can I go "back" to 2.5.8 to actually visually check this issue?'
