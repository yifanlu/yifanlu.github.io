message: 'This first release is for those who obtained a publisher key (that means
  you got an email and you could create a seed then a key for each source sample you
  managed to compile with psm) or their friends. There will be a later second release
  of additional tools for those not having a publisher key or a friend having one.

  Script setup.bat does some key retrieval to sign virtualdefiler corretly then asks
  for your DA version, it s not asking for a password. Just type in 1.15 then press
  the enter key (in your case). You should obtain 2 vitadefiler.* files in the directory
  (they will be sent to the vita through run_homebrew.bat).

  Before dropping hello_world.elf on top of run_homebrew.bat, activate wifi on your
  vita (test with browser that you can reach google.com for example), connect it with
  usb to pc and start dev assistant on vita (it will ask sony server if you have dev
  certificate (will stay valid 7 days, after that will reask it again), then when
  the bat file will try launching debugger it will ask for publisher key from sony
  server). If it stops because you don t have publisher key you will have to wait
  for second future release of the hack. If you have publisher key but it didn t start
  hello world, try running blazedemo the normal way and retry (will force to retrieve
  the publisher key correctly which will stay valid for 24 hours).'
