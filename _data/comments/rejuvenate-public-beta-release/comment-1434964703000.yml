message: 'Brillant work. Could make it work with fw351+da115 and fw318+da114, but
  i noticed heavy dependance on network requests from sony servers (the 7 days long
  dev certificate and the 24 hours long publishing key), so no way for now to keep
  vita in airplane mode. My guess is that on July 15th Sony servers will stop responding.

  BTW here is a tip for when run_homebrew.bat crashes immediately : just manually
  start vitadefiler once in dev assistant, then homebrew.bat will work again correctly.'
