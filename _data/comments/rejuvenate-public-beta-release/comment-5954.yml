message: 'You finally made it :D I''ve been following your progress since the day
  you started to work on the vitaMTP lib. You were the first one pushing for a native
  hack when all the rest of the scene was pushing for porting existing exploits from
  the psp to the vita''s psp emulator. For this you deserve infinite thanks.


  I''ve been using the psm suite for more than 1 year, pushing sony for fixing numerous
  bugs in their sdk but at the time they were already as dead as now. They never invested
  time and money in this PSM and that''s why they failed. I''ve been outraged when
  they announced its disclosure, even if I knew this will happen sooner or later.


  Hopefully you gave it a new life (you could actually not find a better name for
  it :D). And even more, I will be able to code again in native C++ and forget C#
  that drives me crazy each time I have to code on any mobile plateform.


  Thanks again : you really deserve it !'
