message: 'Changing the CID is not enough : NAND keyXs (0x04-0x07) are console-unique,
  derived from the "secret part" of the decrypted OTP (the part that is wiped by the
  bootROM in ITCM).

  Also there are AES-MACs that you would have to change to perform a manual downgrade,
  and once again the keyXs for this MACs are derived from the secret part of the decrypted
  OTP.'
