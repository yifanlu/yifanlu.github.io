message: 'Oh, also I found unproper references to Kernel11:

  "key-slot 0x3D, KeyX set by boot ROM, KeyY set by Kernel11" -&gt; The KeyY is set
  by Process9

  "In Kernel11, slot 0x0 is used with an RSA operation" -&gt; It''s Process9 which
  performs RSA operations.

  "The OTP region is disabled early in the boot process: Kernel11 on the old 3DS"
  -&gt; Kernel9, not Kernel11


  The ARM11 does not have access to AES, RSA or OTP registers.'
