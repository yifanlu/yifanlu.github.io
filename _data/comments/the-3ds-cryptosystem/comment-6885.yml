message: 'The short answer is that the bootrom is disabled by hardware early in the
  boot process so by the time we have control, we cannot access it. And any reset
  we know how to do also resets the cores we have code execution in so resetting makes
  us lose the control. If we find a way to reset while keeping control of execution
  in some processor then it might be a way in. '
