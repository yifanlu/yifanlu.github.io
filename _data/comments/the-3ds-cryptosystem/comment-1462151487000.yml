message: '"Unfortunately, there are still a bunch of shiny keys hidden in the boot
  ROM (which is also disabled like the OTP after use; no mistakes found yet)."


  Can you, either as an update, or as a separate article, shed some more light on
  the issues with dumping the boot ROM and the remaining keys. For instance, will
  an SRESET type hack be possible on the 3DS like was done on the WiiU?'
