message: "I'll assume the comment above was meant for me. I own a Vita for less than a week, and as I stated, I didn't fully grasp what exactly was achieved here, nor how big it was. Perhaps you don't know what \"confused\" means?\r\n\r\n I have nearly NO knowledge on this system, but I am not an idiot. I am well aware that a hack like HENkaku for 3.63 is far from happening. All I wanted to know is if this discovery could potentially lead to something similar in the future. Maybe even a way to downgrade? \r\n\r\nThat's what I wanted to know. Try READING it."
