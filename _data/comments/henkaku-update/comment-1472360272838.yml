message: "@killone: you're confusing the boundaries. We fight for the freedom to use our own devices, not for the freedom to own the servers they have access to. Nowadays you can access your bank account from a hacked device, it doesn't make your bank less secure. If it did, your bank would be in trouble. Similarly, playing on game servers with a hacked devices should not make the game experience shitty, unless the programmers failed at security 101.\r\nYour pool metaphor is completely inaccurate. We want the right to do whatever we want with our swimsuits, not with the pool.\r\n\r\n@Yifan: thanks to you and Team molecule for a great update!"
