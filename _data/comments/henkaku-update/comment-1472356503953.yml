message: "> The whole point of HENkaku is owning your own device. \r\n\r\nI bought a closed platform to play on one, free of hacks on equal footing\r\n\r\nWhy cannot people accept this?\r\nI was born in the early 1980s and ive seen the advantages of open and closed platforms\r\n\r\nbreaking open a closed platform is like breaking into a swimming pool and pooing in the water\r\n\r\nsome people prefer to swim in the ocean (open platform) so a lil poo here and there doesnt bother them\r\n\r\nbut pooing at the community pool (closed platform) is fucking shitty\r\n\r\nso in the coming months my nightly killzone merc sessions will be infected with hackers\r\n\r\nIm so mad. The user exepernce for those who wanted to own a closed platform go down the drain\r\n\r\nthis is especally enragging cause open platforms are cheaper, more powerful as well"
