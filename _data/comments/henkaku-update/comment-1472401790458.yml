message: "@killone\r\n\r\nYou sit there and try to say that there will be less games because of piracy when sony themselves already abandoned the vita and stopped making games for it. Sony does not care about the vita or the people playing on it just look at the price of memory cards on the thing. When the PSP was hacked their was a rush of console sales on that system, its not all about piracy which is how you try to paint it. Maybe you like being tossed into a room and having the door locked on you so you can play with your little black box but some people want to unlock the door and go smell some fresh air for a change."
