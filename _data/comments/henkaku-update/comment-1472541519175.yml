message: "@RAZGRIZ\r\n\r\nfunny you use the psp as an example, piracy held back alot of games being localized for the psp and stopped games from being finished, a simple fact check can confirm this\r\n\r\ndont dishonestly put your head in the sand about it if you decide to research it\r\n\r\nA big reason the vita didnt take off is cause of the mobile market boom \r\n\r\nAnother one was losing monster hunter games to nintendo\r\n\r\nprobly the memory card expense\r\n\r\nAnyhow im done, there is no honor among you thieves\r\n\r\nim 100% confident most of you dont even own original copies of the games you emulate or use \"backups\" for and you think just because the game is old and hard to obtain, you think its okay to pirate it."
