message: You can actually brute force the password because the Linux "root" user uses
  the same password. It's generated using the serial number, but the algo is hard
  to understand after you disassembled it. That's why I choose to patch the file instead
  of trying to find the password. That way, I can remove all checks, including unsigned
  recovery packages.
