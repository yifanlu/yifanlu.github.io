message: "Wow, great information, thanks!  I understand that when you hold the [Enter]\
  \ key on bootup that you get into a recovery context that shows up on the kindle\
  \ 3's screen.  And one of the options in this context is \"E -&gt; Export over USB\"\
  .  A couple of questions:\n\n  (1) As far as you know, is this \"E -&gt; Export\
  \ over USB\" option the same as the \"3. Load MMC0 over USB storage\" option available\
  \ via the RS232 port's recovery mode?\n\n  (2) Do you have any idea what instructions\
  \ are issued (presumibly by recovery-util) to put the kindle into a mode where it\
  \ exports the entire MMC0 via USB.  Imagine a small update style patch that simply\
  \ enables full MMC0 via USB.  That way, as soon as you get a new kindle, you can\
  \ run that one update and get full access to the NAND flash's root file system,\
  \ mount it to a workstation, and customize the root filesystem as you see fit. \
  \ For example, copy over some binaries, install some init.d scripts.  Or even make\
  \ a full block-by-block backup.\n\nIt would be so awesome to have a machine of this\
  \ formfactor with an e-ink display but was easier to backup/restore.  But I presume\
  \ there isn't much of a market for such an open device."
