message: 'Hi!


  I am deeply impressed of your work. I am curiouse if you were able to repeat this
  steps on Kindle 3 (Keyboard) as well? I have a broken Kindle 3. I was able to made
  a hyperterminal connection, but the boot log gave me not to much information. It
  would be the best if you could make me the same recovery kernel for Kindle 3 as
  well. Please inform me if you already done this or plan to do. I can send you the
  bootlog of my Kindle 3G. Thanks for your help in advance!'
