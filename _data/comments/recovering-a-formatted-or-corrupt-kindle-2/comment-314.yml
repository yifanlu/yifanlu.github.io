message: 'I''ve enjoyed reading your posts on kindle hacking.  I''m looking forward
  to getting a kindle 3 wifi myself so I''m learning from you and others as much as
  possible beforehand.  One of the things I''m most concerned about is how to perform
  a full system-image type backup/restore of the device in case things go wrong.


  One thing caught my eye as I was reading your procedure above.  You said, "I moved
  the Kindle over to a Linux computer because it is easier".


  And then you show running dd against "/dev/sdX2".  Does this imply that the kindle''s
  UMASS subsystem is actually serving up the full 2gbyte flash device?  If so, is
  it not possible to backup the entire flash device by accessing "/dev/sdX" directly?  Did
  you put the kindle in a special mode to get it to serve up the full flash device?


  Or did I misunderstand you?  If so, what is your understanding of the structure
  of the data accessible via UMASS vs the structure of the flash device itself?'
