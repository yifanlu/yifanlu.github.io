message: 'I have some ideas about replace the 3g with a wifi card,and i found that
  AR5B95 had a driver on the 2.6.22.

  And I am wondering if I plug it in my dx it would work as k3 wifi.

  Or I have to compile the kernel by myself...Sigh...I don''t know anything about
  it.

  Do you have any suggestion?

  Thank you very much.'
