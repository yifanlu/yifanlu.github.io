message: First of all, the K3 recovery port is different. It uses 1.8V instead of
  3.3V, using 3.3 WILL burn it. Which brings the second difficulty to be finding a
  1.8V TTL to RS232/USB converter. I haven't found one yet and don't have the time
  to make one, so I haven't done a lot of work on the K3. To export the filesystem,
  you CAN dd from SSH, but a better way is using the recovery shell to export directly
  over USB, but in order to do that, you need to patch the kernel to remove the password
  protection on the shell. I will do that one day, but I won't be able to test.
