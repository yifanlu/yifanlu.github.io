message: The thing that bothers me the most about 3DS piracy is that people are paying
  for it by buying the gateway. Thank you, Yifan, for fighting against profiting on
  piracy by releasing this information. Keep up the good work. As for me, I'll keep
  buying my games. If there's one thing I learned about piracy back in high school,
  it's that if I pirate, I have such a huge library that I don't finish any of my
  games and that's just no fun. :(
