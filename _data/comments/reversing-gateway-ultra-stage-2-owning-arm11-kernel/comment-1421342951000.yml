message: "Yeah piracy sucks, though I admit I used to pirate when I was still a student..\
  \  Now I have a decent work,  I now buy my games..  I use homebrews on consoles\
  \ like Multiman on PS3 to backup my games to preserve discs(though I download DLCs\
  \ on the net, coz I think that DLC schemes today suck)..  \n\n\nIf there would something\
  \ on 3DS that can make me play imports and store my games on SD to preserve the\
  \ carts that'll be great.\n\n\nMore power to you Yifan Lu!"
