message: 'If I wasn''t clear about this, let me make it clear: I despise piracy. The
  only reason I''m posting all this information is because I believe information should
  be free and not held by a small group of elites. I know that regardless of what
  I do, piracy will continue and those who want to pirate are already downgrading
  their consoles so I don''t think this information will enable a large number of
  people who couldn''t pirate before to pirate now. That being said, what you do with
  this information is your business. If you want to make a free piracy loader, go
  ahead. My only goal is providing information.'
