message: 'This is a great post, thanks for explaining everything with such great detail.
  I totally agree in not making the exploit public, please keep it that way.


  And a big thanks for working so hard on this. It is really amazing that you were
  able to go so far. I hope somehow we''ll be able to find a usable exploit in the
  PSP emulator. That way, we would have access to most of the hardware for homebrews,
  and we would still be far from pirating games.'
