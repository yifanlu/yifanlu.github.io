message: 'I understand how difficult it must be to fund everything you''re doing for
  this project, but I''m sorry that I cannot donate anything towards it. Your progress
  here is very interesting and incredible already. Your dedication and commitment
  towards this, everything you''re doing is much appreciated by the whole community.
  Thank you for actually dedicating yourself towards this, whereas others have just
  gave up, or aren''t as knowledgeable as you. You''re a lot smarter than you make
  out to be. (Davee better stop stealing partial bits of information from you) SKFU
  seems to have realized that people know he''s not really making any real progress.


  And we all know piracy (not just piracy), but emulators and custom apps, plugins
  and new discoveries will increase vita hardware sales once it''s been natively modded.
  Not only that, but breaking the boundaries, maxing out clock speed to 2GHz, and
  so many things I just can''t think about right now, due to it being 1:39am.


  Last gen was the PSP era, and we don''t need to repeat it on the vita. ignorantly
  put (sorry)

  Been 2 years... PS4 NAND was cracked in less than 2 weeks or 2 months; though it
  makes sense, because of the totally different hardware on the PS4 being more similar
  to a PC.


  Would be awesome if people did pay an equal amount of attention to the Vita.


  This is your progress. You''re the only one who''s actually ''genuinely'' got this
  far before, been as kind as to document everything, and give a thorough analysis.
  Great job; Yifan Lu.

  You''ve made a major breakthrough of information regarding the vita already. We
  all support you, but it must be very difficult for most of us to donate; unfortunately.
  Best of luck.'
