message: No offense, but my day job isn't making hacks for your phones. It's a hobby,
  and like all hobbies, I do it on my own free time. And there is no where near enough
  donations for me to consider doing this as a "job" (and from all the demand, I though
  I would see more, lol). All you (or you one guy who keeps posting under different
  names) who are "begging" me, my previous answer(s) still stand.
