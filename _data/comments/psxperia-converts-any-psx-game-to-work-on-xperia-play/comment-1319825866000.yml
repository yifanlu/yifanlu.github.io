message: 'Quick question: Can save files from PS1 games on Xperia Play be transferred
  to play on PSP or the PS3?


  I figure since these are actual rips of the original game, the save information
  should be exactly the same? With the PSP iso, you can move the save file to the
  PS3 and continue playing on the official version of the game from the PSN store.'
