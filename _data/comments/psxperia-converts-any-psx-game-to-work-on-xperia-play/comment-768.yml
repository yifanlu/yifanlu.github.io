message: 'Hi Yifan:

  1) Thank you SO much for your hard work on this, this looks amazing.

  2) I am having alot of problems with this.  I have numerous old playstation disks
  so I have been ripping ISO''s like mad (ive used Power ISO and Magic ISO)  The only
  one that has worked for me is Crash Bandicoot 3.  I have tried NHL Open Ice, Dragon
  Ball GT, Tekken 3, and Gex enter the Gekko.  None have worked. I follow your instructions
  to the T.  Load up the file onto my Xperia, go into Astro or ES file manager (ive
  used both)  As soon as I finish installing it Force Closes.  Then if you try to
  open the installed file, it says it is not installed on the SD card.  Not sure what
  is going on.  Any thoughts?'
