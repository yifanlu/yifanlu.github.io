  I tried to convert a ps1 game with this tool, and when it tried to extract the apk
  and zpak, i got an error message, "cannot extract" or something like that, then
  it deleted everything on my hdd.


  EDIT BY MODERATOR:

  This was just a coincidence if it were true. There is no code in psxperia that would
  format the hard drive.'
