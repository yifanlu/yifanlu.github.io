message: "Works great for almost every game I've tried so far. The ones that don't,\
  \ oh well. I mean that's the chance you take with emulation really. Thank you for\
  \ the hard work and effort you put in to this. It's taken my Play to a level beyond\
  \ running just basic Android games and 16 bit console emulation.    \n\nAlso, the\
  \ ability to shift the installed .apk formats to the sd card after installation\
  \ is brilliant. Even Sony hasn't done that with anything official from them."
