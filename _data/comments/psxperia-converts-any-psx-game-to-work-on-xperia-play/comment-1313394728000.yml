message: Awesome! BUT I haven't got any games to really work yet. I have tried two
  so far and they both seem to start fine but then I just get a lot of sound and graphic
  glitches and the games crash. Both runs fine in FPSe. I'll keep experimenting and
  try other games to see if I can get something working.
