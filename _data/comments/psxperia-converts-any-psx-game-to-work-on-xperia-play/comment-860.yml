message: 'Hi

  I know you haven''t said anything about this working on Tablet S but i have tried
  it and it doesn''t work. when I try to convert the iso at the last point it just
  says "checking to see all files are there" I think its meant to say "Check" rather
  that "Checking". can you offer any help. there are know missing files. I think it
  may be to do with the CRC thing. My tablet S is a UK model.'
