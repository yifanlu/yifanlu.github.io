message: 'I''m afraid there is some truth to what ''the one'' posted - I chose the
  apk and zpak, chose my desktop as the output directory, pressed extract and got
  an error message ''can''t delete valkyrie profile iso'' (I happened to be transferring
  it from an external sd card) - wondered WTH, refreshed my desktop and it wiped everything
  apart from my computer and documents desktop icon, and an iso that happened to be
  mounted virtually.


  My OS is W7 Starter x86 if it helps.


  Glad I didn''t choose C:/ as my output directory!'
