message: Loved this utility! I would pay money for it. Unfortunately since the mandatory
  Crash Bandicoot apk update to 1.2, previously converted games prompt an update and
  exit, and any new conversions just load to a black screen... Any hope for a quick
  fix? Get 'er working again and I WILL pay money for it :-)
