message: 'Hi, apparently I''m too dumb to get this to work :(


  I found the 2 files needed on my phone, copied them to my harddrive, made an ISO
  of the game I''d like to emulate, I used your tool to create the data files, and
  used the data files with my ISO, copied the com to the appropriate folder on the
  phone and my .APK file to the phone and installed. It shows up in my list of apps
  and the Xperia play list of games just fine, but when I try and open it, I get the
  "updating..." dialogue for a split second before the app closes as if nothing ever
  happened.


  Can you help an illiterate person like me out? Many thanks. ( I tried the trouble
  shooting, I dont have FPSE and this is my first attempt at PS Emulation on my xperia)'
