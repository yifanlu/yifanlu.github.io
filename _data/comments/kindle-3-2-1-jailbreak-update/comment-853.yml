message: "Hi Yifanlu\n\nThe jailbreak hack is great and is the only one that worked\
  \ on my kindle. I am suggesting a new hack. \nI hate how the kindle web browser\
  \ will only download a few file types. I also dislike the fact that I can't see\
  \ the progress of the download. Maybe you or Serge could create a hack for a download\
  \ manager? That would be great. Keep up the good work.\n\n~Brad F."
