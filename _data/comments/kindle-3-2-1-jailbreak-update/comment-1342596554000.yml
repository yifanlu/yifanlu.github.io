message: Days ago i got a second hand kindle keyboard 3G B0006 with 3.2.1 frameware,
  then it upgraded to 3.3 automatically ... Yesterday, I tried the jailbreak package.
  it goes well, but today i just found that can't make any bookmark and set up the
  collection anymore. When I restart kindle, then I come back to the original status.
  Did i do something wrong?
