  The only thing jailbreak does is giving you ability to install custom, non-Amazon
  issued updates, also known as `hacks''. And these hacks can perform changing screensavers,
  removing ads, almost everything. Or can choose not to do so, depending on their
  authors will.


  Both screensaver hacks I''ve heard about - NiLuJe''s and Sir Alex''s - intentionally
  do not support removing ads from Kindle with Special Offers.'
