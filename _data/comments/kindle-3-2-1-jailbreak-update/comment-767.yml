  It''s for 3.2.1 only. Might be un-operatable on 3.2.


  K3w,

  I''ve tried it on the Kindle 3 WiFi without ads with firmware version 3.2.1. Factory
  new, without any unsuccessfull attempts to install original Yifan''s jailbreak.
  It installed OK. Looking through the sources I see, that the only way to obtain
  U0006 is to have Kindle jailbroken already.

  If you installed jailbreak on 3.2 prior to updating to 3.2.1, you do not need this
  one - custom hacks should install correctly.'
