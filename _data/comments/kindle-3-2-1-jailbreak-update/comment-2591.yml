message: 'I generally hate having to look at ads, but those on the Kindle are far
  less intrusive and obnoxious than those on 90% of the web sites I visit.


  Maybe if I use my kindle keyboard 3g as a reader, I would feel differently. But
  I mainly use mine as a web browser while away from home and I''m much more bothered
  by the browser''s limitations even when using wifi and thus not costing Amazon money
  for 3G.


  Are there other browsers that I can try installing? Also, is there a way to download
  mp3''s and even short videos via wifi? Could I install the UNIX program <i>curl
  </i> or something like it that I could run from the terminal?'
