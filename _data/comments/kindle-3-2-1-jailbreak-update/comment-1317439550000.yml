message: 'Here''s my situation:


  My originial Kindle 3 Wi-Fi broke due to software issues and Amazon agreed to replace
  it. Great. I recieve it only to find out that they gave me a Kindle 3 Wi-Fi with
  Special Offers on 3.2.1 firmware. Naturally angry I call customer service, apparently
  with the click of a button they were able to remove the ads. Now my problem is that
  I''m still on 3.2.1 FW and  there is no screensaver hack. Please help.'
