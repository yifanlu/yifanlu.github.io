message: 'My device is Kindle 3 ad version 3G+wifi. Package version is 3.2.1. Last
  night i almost tried all the ways to jailbreak, all were failed untill i found this
  way. i tried it and succeeded.Then i install custom hack:update_pinyin_0.2_k3g_install.bin,
  and also suceeded. But there is still ads on my kindle. i am confused about one
  problem. Is that there will be no ads after kindle is jailbroken?
