message: "Thank you for the Jailbreaks. I have been using your work for a while now\
  \ and really appreciate it! \n\nI fully support the 'homebrew' scene, but for all\
  \ you jerks out there too cheap to buy the 'NON-add-supported' verison, suck it\
  \ up!\n\nThe jailbreaks give us the ability to run our own software, fonts and screen\
  \ savers. if you don't want the adds, pay the extra $40! It's not much.\n\nAlso\
  \ realise no one made you buy the add supported version, you bought it and you KNEW\
  \ what you were in for.\n\nI don't much agree with copy-rights and restrictions\
  \ (I pay my fair share for apps, I nearly ALWAYS donate or pay for shareware etc)....\
  \ \n\nStill, I use the jailbreak because I HATE how Amazon doesn't let me change\
  \ *my* screen savers (even though I paid for the full version of the Kindle).. \n\
  \nBUT I'm not so much a cheap asshole that I try to hack a CHEAP device like the\
  \ kindle, to get rid of adverts that I already *WILLINGLY* agreed to!\n\nAnyway.\
  \ I'm still running 3.2.1 and Update Screensaver Hack 2.5.. I haven't tried updating\
  \ yet I'll wait and read a few more examples of experiences before I risk losing\
  \ my screensavers!) :)\n\nThanks again Yifran Lu!\nA lot of us appreciate your work!\n\
  \nObM."
