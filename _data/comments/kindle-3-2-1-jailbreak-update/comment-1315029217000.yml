message: 'I installed the new version of jailbreak for version 3.2.1 and then install
  the screensaver hack. All the upgrades with no problems. However, when I inserted
  the images in the specified folder and restarted the Kindle, the ads continued.


  So I added the screensaver and jailbreak uninstall files and perform upgrades in
  sequence. Also no problem.


  Now, when trying to get the whole operation from the beginning, inserting the jailbreak
  .bin, the upgrade failed.


  Where is the error?


  Thanks for the help.
