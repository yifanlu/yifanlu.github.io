message: I understand your concern and I agree. Although I said I won't promise any
  releases, I will be posting hardware details and stuff. The main goal is demystifying
  the vita internals and it is up to others to use that information as needed. Anything
  I post will be along the lines of "here's how you dump the NAND" of "here's where
  these pins on the CPU goes to". Think something like ifixit but more in depth.
