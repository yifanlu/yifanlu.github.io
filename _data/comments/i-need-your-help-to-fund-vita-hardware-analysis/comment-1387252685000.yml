message: The problem is exactly that. I don't WANT a piracy company to hack it. The
  end doesn't justify the means. These piracy companies give a bad name to all homebrew
  lovers. Plus, the exploit difficult to set up, so the last thing I want is a bunch
  of emails asking me how to get it working every day.
