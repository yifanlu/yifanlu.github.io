message: 'However true, as anyone educated in history would know, in many cases, history
  has a great deal of potential to repeat itself. I don''t want it hacked for piracy
  reasons, just as you don''t, but due to the utter lack of interest from the most
  prominent names in the hardware hacking scenes, it really seems like the choice
  is to either have it hacked for nefarious purposes, or never see it truly hacked.
  I mean, sure, we could both go back to collage or university and get hardware engineering
  degrees, but that''ll take just as long, if not longer, than it will for a company
  to crack it and therefore open it up for the rest of us to salvage. A true hack
  can allow for anything we want it too, just like a gun, it''s how we choose to take
  advantage of it that defines the scene. I guess at the end of the day, it''s more
  of the choice between "Do I want it hacked for everything?" or "Do I want it locked
  forever?". As without an explosive burst of interest in the unit, I doubt the third
  option will ever be available, as sad as that thought makes me.


  Regardless, I have two Vitas running 1.81. Should you discover the pinout for the
  NAND, I''ll be happy to help you test it among other things. It should allow for
  the Wiki to be updated as well, which would be a nice change.'
