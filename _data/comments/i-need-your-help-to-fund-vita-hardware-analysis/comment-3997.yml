message: 'I read what VC had to say and your replies...and im quite dissapointed.
  So whats the point of all this anyway? why are you doing this then ?  if you say
  you dont want to see Vita hacked or share the results with other hackers with better
  skills that can maybe help you/us all. You know its really starting to get pathetic.
  Every device out there gets hacked, everyone wants it hacked (PS4 or X1), yet the
  Vita community plays the good samaritan : we are saints, we dont hack it, we dont
  want piracy, we want some BS homebrews and TOTALLY worthless PSP eCFW exploits and
  VHBL crap, which can ran on a PC and at 1080p quality which craps on Vita eCFW anyday  (PPSSPP).
  Please correct me if i understood wrong.'
