message: Thanks for the reply. Ok i get it now. Anyway your initiative is good regardless  If
  only more would follow you....it's quite a shame most of them are now focused on
  PS4 or X1. While Vita even without piracy, CFW, it's still pretty much going down
  compared to how PSP performed the same period (and PSP was hacked).Whatever it's
  good to see people like you still having interest in PS Vita. Good luck to your
  findings and sorry my english.
