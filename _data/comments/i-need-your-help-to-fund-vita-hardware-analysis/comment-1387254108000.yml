message: 'Well, from a historical stand-point, it seems that no matter the initial
  intentions, all consoles that are ever hacked are predominantly subjugated to the
  purpose of running backups. Of course, that''s not the ideal, but having full system
  access might just be worth letting them win this time. Consider this, for example.
  Datel, with the Action Replay for the GameCube, enabled clever hackers to inject
  code to boot homebrew code from an SD card. This led to the discovery of the potential
  for the PSO hack, and helped to open up the Gamecube quite a bit for everyone else.
  Of course, having a team like Tweezers crack it open for 100% homebrew intentions
  would be amazing, but judging from the current history of the Vita, it doesn''t
  seem all that viable, from a time and resource perspective. That''s just my opinion
  though. On the topic of setting up your exploit, I''m sure compiling a set of instructions
  good enough for one of the scene coordinators, like Wololo, to manage would be sufficient.
  Once it''s out there, the other members of the scene will be most likely happy to
  share information about getting it working, even if they don''t share all their
  personal progress and code along with it. Additionally, it''s not like you''re obligated
  to answer everyone''s questions about it. Once they have it, most of the competent
  scene will be able to figure it out without your assistance. Never the less though,
  it''s your code, and your choice. No one can truly pressure you to release it, only
  present the facts on the possibilities that can be brought up as a result.


  Of course, don''t take my opinion as anything more than a neutral statement, just
  a quantification of my thoughts. I hold nothing against you for any of your current
  decisions, so please continue doing what you already are. You have me support regardless.'
