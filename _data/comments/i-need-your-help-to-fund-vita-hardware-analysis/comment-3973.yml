message: As the usermode exploit was patched, is there any chance of you releasing
  it at least to the well known developers in hopes of discovering a bit more about
  the kernel calls? Heck, if a Chinese piracy company got hold of it, as a foothold,
  they might actually take the time and money to get a bit more out of the console.
  Anyway, that isn't to say that I think the PSVita should be outright hacked for
  piracy, but considering the required funds to do it right, that does seem like the
  most logical path. As the exploit in question has been long since patched, I can't
  see it being a real problem to at least have those able to run it doing research
  on it. Either way, I support your efforts and plan to donate. Thanks for taking
  the initiative, it's been far too long since we, as a scene, have really made any
  real progress on this device. Cheers, and hope something great comes of this!
