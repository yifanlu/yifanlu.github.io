message: You have to understand that Sony is a no-bullshit company. They will sue
  you not because you did anything illegal but to intimidate others who want to do
  the same. None of us want to deal with that, so we can't give them any ammo. I'll
  do my best to provide the most information I can without even getting near the line
  of legal vs illegal. I cannot speak for others, but I DO want to see the device
  hacked. And I believe there is a way to do so while still making it hard to pirate.
  But we are not at the point to be thinking about those things yet.
