message: 'When you previously had a software exploit you never released it due to
  a, "homebrew leads to piracy", excuse. Can we expect a similar outcome here if your
  discoveries lead to exploits?

  You should come clean and state your plans above before you start taking people''s
  money. They''ll expect more than teaser videos and jpegs now that they''re funding
  you.'
