message: Good question. $437.87 and I think 0.1BTC (need to verify). I spent $210.72
  on supplies so far. By request, $70 will not be donated to the EFF. So I'll have
  $37.87+0.1BTC to donate to the EFF (for sure) and $227.15 left to potentially buy
  a working vita (for dumping) or if that's not needed, also donated to EFF. Hope
  that's detailed enough. Let me know if you would like to see reciepts or anything.
