message: you know about the video output i was wondering, did SKFU showcased it's
  dev kit Vita mobo? maybe we can see what the HDMI connector is using for signal.
  Where it leads to. And maybe we could reproduce it on regular vita's too right?
  then it will remain the software. But maybe someone can make a custom driver for
  it just like they managed to make one for the Vita capture card. Can all this be
  possible? could a consumer Vita's motherboard still have HDMI capability just like
  a dev kit?
