message: "Hi Yifan Lu,\r\n\r\nI am following your work since you were doing some stuff in egpu.io, in which you were able to do some good stuff in really few time, and then you disappeared (not blaming you, I gues you don't want do deal with this kind of stuff). Then, I followed your ps vita work, which is impressive.\r\nI have seen you are kind of like a reverse engineering guru (as you do it full time), and that's why I would like to ask you for some help.\r\n\r\nI did some stuff when I was at college like almost 20 years ago, with win32dasm and softice... but not for really fancy stuff, just really small cracking stuff, like change conditionals a JNE for a JMP or a inhibit some code with a NOP. But that's all. And it is being a while.\r\nToday, I am still a programmer, but nothing related with reverse engineering. I work more with graphics stuff and VFX.\r\n\r\nComing to the point of the need of your help. I will give your some context. I use a program which is called SideFX Houdini. Obviously I have it legal at work, but at home sometimes I want to do or prototype something, and a fully license is required in order to do it.\r\nWhen a new version is release, the X-Force group makes a new crack version, but sometimes it takes a lot of months to get it.\r\n\r\nBasically is a licensing crack, and basically it has 2 parts:\r\n- The keygen for the different kind of licenses you could have (there are many components in Houdini, and all of them require a difference licensing, like rendering, or simulations... etc...).\r\n- The sesinetd, which is a low level tool which works with the licensing manager, which it validates the licenses generated previously.\r\n\r\nSome people -like me-, are able to modify the keygen (pretty lame mode, changing in hex the version of the tool to the new one, not fancy stuff), in order to make it work for the following version (not major releases, but half, like from Houdini 17 to Houdini 17.5, but usually doesn't work in Houdini 18 -sometimes in windows does, but not in MacOS, which is the one I use-). Obviously with a modified version of the keygen, if there is a new license for a new tool, there is not chance to get it. And it is not a good solution.\r\n\r\nSo I was trying to do something with a Ida Pro version (7.x something but a little bit old), but I really need help as it is complicated. I was trying to use ghidra as well, but as it has no debugger (and should be great to interact with the licensing program) it is all super static, and can perform tests easily.\r\n\r\nMy goal is been able to make a keygen and a modified sesinetd to make it work from scratch, and therefore be able to make it even for newer versions.\r\n\r\nIf I ask that is because it seems to be not that hard to be able to do it, once you got the tools. I was able to get the decompiled c++ for the licensing strings which for the validator (I guess it is this, but I am not sure, it is just a guess).\r\n\r\nThe latest version of Houdini is Houdini 18, and  there is no crack released whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSo now, the question. Can you help me with the process of cracking that?\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I am not asking you for giving me the fish, but for teaching me how to fish.\r\n\r\nI know that everyone has his life and is super busy at work, so I understand if you are not able to make it.\r\n\r\nThanks and greetings.\r\n\r\nEd\r\n\r\nPS: don't know where to find your mail address... the captcha in your web doesn't work..."
