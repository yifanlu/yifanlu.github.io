  @Wololo, I don't have a magic device that measures the interest of the "scene"
  nor do I care about what the "scene" likes or don't like. However, here's
  three facts. 1) some people (like me) own and play mostly physical games, 2)
  we can't just dump our games because the current dumpers are shit and corrupt
  games and cause issues like saves disappearing after standby as well as saves
  being incompatible with non-hacked Vitas (via upgrading fw or CMA transfer),
  and 3) the gamecard_microsd driver is more complex than usbmc and therefore
  more likely to contain issues (one issue already discovered is that Vitas wake
  up from standby often which might affect battery life)--this can be fixed by
  software but nobody has picked up the mantel from xyz so who knows when it
  will be fixed or if it will ever be fixed. usbmc on the other hand has been in
  VitaShell for months and no issues have been discovered so far.
