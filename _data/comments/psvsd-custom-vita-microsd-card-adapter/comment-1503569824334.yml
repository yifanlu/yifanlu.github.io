message: "I think that \"IDGAF\" attitude you have is what I like about you, Yifan. To hell with the scene, do what you feel is best for your own personal development. \r\n\r\nI don't mean to discredit SD2Vita by any means (it's a godsend on PSV Slim; which I own in addition to my 3G Vita), but I feel your psvsd is far more interesting and impressive. If I can find the energy within me, I may sell some psvsd on eBay for a reasonable price. My only concern as of right now is, you mentioned on indiegogo that you had to manually do some soldering on the final design. Has the design been updated on your github page to include the card detect fix?"
