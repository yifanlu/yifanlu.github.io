message: "Neat.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I don't like about these story-driven problems is that I tend to read too much into the story and the implied expectations regarding complexity (which is bad as an engineer, but a very good bias as a project manager/tech lead ;)\r\n\r\nFor example, you mention that the number of bananas could reach 2^30 - 1 because it's an int. Great. That also happens to be the world production of bananas for one year. How do you buy so many bananas? How do you convince all banana exporting companies to sell and ship those to the prison?  Shouldn't you take into account the life expectancy of the rabbits and the guards when you deal with such insane numbers?\r\n\r\nAlso, Why the F... is there a doomsday device in this scenario. So many questions, distracting me from the actual problem.\r\n:)"
