  I kinda just thought, if the sum is odd, they'll never have an equal number so
  just look for those pairings. Any time it's even, it will probably even out
  eventually. It seems the test cases bear that out. You need at least one odd
  and one even number to sum to an odd number, and that pairing will lead to two
  guards distracted.  All odd or all even inputs will not distract the guards.
  Did I oversimplify or misunderstand the problem?
