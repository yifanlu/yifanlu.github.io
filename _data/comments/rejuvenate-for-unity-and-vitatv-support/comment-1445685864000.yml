message: 'Hi Yifan Lu,


  I want your honest opinion..,


  It''s been 4 years since the PS Vita was released. At first, I was quite annoyed
  and frustrated because there hasn''t been any progress (or so i felt) on the PS-Vita
  and basically they were turning the Vita into a PSP v2.0 (when you can practically
  buy a PSP for $50 and hack it), and that the Vita was being used for everything
  BUT the actual Vita itself, which I think defeats the entire purpose of having a
  PS-Vita (If I want any of the emulators, I have my PSP for that, rendering the Vita
  to be just an expensive paperweight).


  Then I read your articles and realized why it has been taking so long for the Vita
  to actually be "hacked" and I feel somewhat educated. But I want you to tell me
  honestly Yifan Lu:


  Is there any hope for the PS-Vita to be hacked at all, and be able to ever run CFW
  and play PS-Vita ISOs? Or will the PS-Vita never be able to play ISOs ever? I feel
  like at this point in time, the PS-Vita will be the first console to never be able
  to be hacked and if that does happen, I will be majorly disappointed. I have been
  in the modding community for almost all my life and the PS-Vita has been nothing
  but a disappointment for the last 4 years. I don''t really care for homebrew (as
  stated by my reasons above), and in my eyes, until the PS-Vita can actually run
  PS Vita ISOs and allow full-kernel access, then hacking wise, the PS-Vita will always
  be a failure.'
