  Hello. I have big problem - I have installed debug shell on vita which is
  incompatible with relase 5 and up. The bad thing is my little brother formated
  my vita memory card and now I can't install actual release with henkaku 6. Is
  possibility to upload henkaku release 4 on another server to uninstall this
  debug shell? Because on release 6 debug shell I have still make me the same
  error. Any chance of it? Regards and thanks for Your hard work!
