message: This is amazing, I can't imagine how much hard work went into creating this.  Why
  the firmware limit though?  Does it check which version?  Because if it has to be
  on the most recent version, and you can't upgrade from 3.60 anyway, why not just
  let it be compatible with all?  I look forward to seeing this and other HENkaku
  mysteries being resolved in coming days and weeks.
