message: 'Finally!! Can’t wait to have some new emulators and overclock the Vita.


  Maybe i’ll be able to play Assassin Creed, Borderland and especially Jak and Daxter
  without an headache !!!

  Do you think it’s possible?

  Or the CPU speed limit is coded on the game so he can’t use the added speed even
  if the CPU is overclocked?'
