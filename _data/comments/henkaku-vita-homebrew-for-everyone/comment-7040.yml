message: "I have a Vita TV with 1.60 already, so I figured there was nothing to loose\
  \ by trying this. I successfully installed HENkaku and molecularShell, then got\
  \ whitelister1_1.vpk installed as well.\n\nLaunched whitelister and then tried out\
  \ the incompatible physical games that I've got that don't normally boot at all\
  \ on the Vita TV. \n\nGot tons of stuff working: \n\nGravity Rush (U)\nHyperdimension\
  \ Neptunia PP (U)\nResistance Burning Skies (U)\nTearaway (U) boots, but crashes\
  \ (probably due to the missing hardware; no big deal just thought I'd try it anyway)\n\
  Uncharted Golden Abyss (U)\nWipeout 2048 (U)\nYs: Memories of Celceta (U)\n\nhowever,\
  \ these games still do NOT work:\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 (U)\nMoe\
  \ Chronicle (Asia)\n\nI don't understand why these games don't even boot. They still\
  \ give the same old not compatible error you'd norally get with stock firmware.\
  \ Neither game uses any of the Vita's extra features beyond just the touch screen.\
  \ and even then the touch screen isn't crutial to normal gameplay.\n\nDoes anyone\
  \ know of any way to fix these to get these working? In particular I really want\
  \ to play Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 on my PSTV with HENkaku. Thanks for\
  \ any help!"
