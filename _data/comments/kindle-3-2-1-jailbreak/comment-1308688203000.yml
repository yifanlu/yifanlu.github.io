message: 'I posted this on mobileread.com. Is it possible:


  Instead of doing "Update your Kindle" if we do a simple "Restart", on restart the
  kindle will see the bin file and try to load the update. Since in this case the
  kindle will initiate the update process id will be within a smaller range and will
  increase the success rate.


  I am very new to Kindle world. Forgive me if I am wrong.'
