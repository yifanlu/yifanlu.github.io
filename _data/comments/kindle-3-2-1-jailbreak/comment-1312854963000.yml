message: I got the jailbreak to work successfully on my 3.2.1 (spec offers version),
  and uploaded some custom screensavers. It worked beautifully until I turned the
  wifi back on, at which point the ad supported screensavers and banners came back,
  replacing my custom screensavers. I still see my custom screensavers in the linkss
  folder when I plug it in though. Any ideas on how to get the customs to stay put
  when wireless is activated??
