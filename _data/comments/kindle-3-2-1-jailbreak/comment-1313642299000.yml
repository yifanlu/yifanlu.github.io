message: 'This is great, but it didn''t work. I have the kindle 3.2.1 wifi, it just
  has pics of emily dickenson, jules verne, etc - no ads, so these get boring fast.
  I would love to have these screensavers plus my own, I don''t know why Amazon would
  be opposed to that; or just my own would be great - so anyway I am trying to use
  your jailbreak, but it didn''t work? Any advice, please help...


  I suspect your enticement: "If you have serial port access on your Kindle 3, send
  me the otaup log and Iâ€™ll change the pid set" might need doing, but I have no idea
  what that means in plain English!


  Please help!'
