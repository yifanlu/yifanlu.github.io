message: 'I can''t get mine to jailbreak.  I have 3.2.1 and I copy the .bin file immediately
  after Windows recognizes it but it''s unclear whether you unplug the Kindle after
  you do that, or just eject it so that you can get to the settings menu. I copy the
  bin file as soon as it will take it, then I unplug the Kindle and get to the upgrade
  as soon as I can... I get the 007 error every time.

  Ideas?'
