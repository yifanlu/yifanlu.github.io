message: "Hi everybody... actually u don't need to reset your Kindle and hurry up\
  \ to plug your cable in ... and swear because your Kindle isn't detected by your\
  \ OS on time.,, if you have Mac Os or linux, just open terminal/ console and copy\
  \ update*.bin file using dd command.\nfor example if the downloaded folder is in\
  \ Downloads you just type \n\n\ndd if=/Users/YOUR_NAME/Downloads/kindle-3.2.1-jailbreak-0.5/update_jailbreak_0.5_k3w_install.bin\
  \ of=/Volumes/Kindle/update_jailbreak_0.5_k3w_install.bin"
