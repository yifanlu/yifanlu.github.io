message: 'In the readme.txt of the package, it says "k3 = Kindle 3 Wifi + 3G (US &amp;
  Canada) k3g = Kindle 3 Wifi + 3G (Elsewhere)", should it be "k3g = Kindle 3 Wifi
  + 3G (US &amp; Canada) k3gb = Kindle 3 Wifi + 3G (Elsewhere)" instead? As I couldn''t
  find a bin file called k3.


  Thanks for the work Yifan!'
