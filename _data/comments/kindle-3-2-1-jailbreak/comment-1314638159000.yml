message: Thank you so much!! I have a Kindle 3 with wifi and 3G(international), the
  no advertisement version and the jailbreak worked like a charm. It took my a while
  to set it up from the lack of experience doing this sort of thing but I eventually
  was able to do everything on time and can can now have my beautiful personal screensavers!
