message: 'COMMENT 186 - 10/14/2011 Yifan Lu: "I’m not mad at you, but at the fact
  that so many people do not read.  You don’t have to get all passive aggressive with
  me, I’m not your mother."


  Active aggression is more than possible, but I''d rather not waste time schooling
  the verbally challenged.  I DO read and when writing is done in a clear, concise
  manner there is no misunderstanding.  You need to stop being snotty and simply cope
  with the fact some will seek further clarification due to your obtuse writing style.'
