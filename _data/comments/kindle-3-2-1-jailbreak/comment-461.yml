  Works with Kingle 3 wifi FW 3.2.1 at the first attempt.

  I have renamed the "document" and "system" folders and put off the wifi like recommended.

  @k3w : I haven''t the kindle drive during the boot sequence. I have just copy the
  bin file as soon as the boot sequence is over.

  In fact, i had a windows with wy computer hard drive open and typing "F5", "F5"
  etc... all along the boot sequence. As soon as i see "kindle" (It appears as soon
  as the boot sequence seems over).'
