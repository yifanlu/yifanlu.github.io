message: 'UPDATE for those still having problems


  This did not show up when I tried to post the first time, but since it is important,
  I will repost


  Kindle 3.2.1 (576290015) special offers works but still might have ! instead of
  check mark.


  If your error report says U007 at the bottom left of the Kindle, there is a good
  chance your jailbreak might have worked. Mine did.


  Try installing Duokon or the screensaver thing. If you read PDFs, you should definitely
  consider Duokon for the text reflow and manual trimming funtctions.


  If you have tried this jailbreak over and over and got it to work this time, I recommend
  backing your Kindle up, doing a factory reset, and then reapplying the jailbreak.
  You can then copy your documents back over. This shouldn’t hurt, and will help assure
  that you didn’t do any damage while tampering with it trying to get the jailbreak
  to work.


  Also, I think it is worth mentioning on here: if you use your kindle to browse,
  you may have noticed links that or set to open in a new window do not work. There
  is a fix for this at http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=110818&page=3.
  Grab readability.zip at post number 43 and follow the instructions on post 46. This
  redirects links set to open in a new window so that they can open in the same window.
  Thanks to kindle3zeng for the mod. Also, if anyone knows where I can get that libwebkit
  file (different mod for the same purpose) please share! I’d like to try it out,
  but I could not find it on the link given in the thread: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=135011
  I do not know Chinese, but I tried clicking several of the links, and none of them
  seemed to have opened a download for libwebkit-1.0.so.2.5.0. I would really appreciate
  it! I think this mod might suit my need better.


  Thanks Yifan Lu for the awesome jailbreak! I now have Duokon and working weblinks
  which are really making things much better for browsing and pdfs.'
