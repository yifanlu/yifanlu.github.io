message: '@K3w Jailbroken as of yesterday using this on a KSO 3.2.1(576290015), second
  try copying the .bin over manually then ejecting. I didnt need to use any of the
  scripts posted. The first attempt, I just tried a restart as mentioned by someone,
  but it didnt take. Second attempt worked fine using update instead of just a restart.
  I had wireless off, and renamed "documents" to "documents.bak" and created a new
  empty documents folder.'
