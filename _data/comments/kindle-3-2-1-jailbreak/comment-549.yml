message: 'Hello,

  First of all thank you for your work.

  Second,

  I''ve managed to install the jailbreak,at least there was nothing to indicate that
  I failed to do so,after I installed the bin file there was a tick on the screen
  telling me that the installination was successful.


  After this step,I tried installing the screensaver hack called "kindle-ss-0.22.N.zip",even
  though it says that the update is succesfully installed,I somehow cant get it to
  work,I have rebooted and added another wallpaper but no use.


  Any help would be appericiated.'
