  I''ve JB-ed it, installed usbnetwork and DK on a KSO.


  Several tips/suggestions:

  1) Before applying the JB, turn off the wi-fi. (I got 5 or 6 failed trials before
  I finally noticed this).


  2) If you use Windows, take a look at the drive labelled as "Kindle" when your K3
  connected to your computer, and write down it, for example "E:"; then after you
  restart the K3 and connect K3 to PC with USB cable, run the following script in
  a CMD window:

  for /l %i in (1,1,10000000) do dir E: &amp;&amp; copy update_jailbreak_0.5_k3w_install.bin
  E: &amp;&amp; exit

  (it keeps trying to copy the file to that drive and exit once it''s done).


  3) If you wanna install Duokan (for Chinese user), you need first install usbnetwork-0.33,
  and copy DK''s folders to root of Kindle drive. Then telnet/ssh to kindle via usb
  or wifi to run the following script on your kindle:

  sh /mnt/us/DK_System/install/install.sh

  (this is just the installation script of Duokan, which cannot be executed by its
  update bin file, so you need to do it manually. Now you can "reboot" your kindle
  to make it work).'
