  Just arrived at my door yesterday, June 23. I have tried running the jailbreak 40
  times or so with no success. Exclamation point and error code every time. I''ve
  tried all of the aforementioned methods as well as some others. I ran the terminal
  script to do the instant copy and eject, Wi-Fi on, Wi-Fi off, registered, unregistered,
  reset to factory defaults, changed documents and settings folders, left them as
  they were, left no folders whatsoever, used the update your kindle method, used
  the restart method, etc... I suppose mine is just unbreakable :/'
