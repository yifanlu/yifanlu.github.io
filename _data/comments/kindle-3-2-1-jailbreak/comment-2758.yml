message: 'I cannot update my kindle 3.2.1 to 3.3, it fails after showing "successful"
  once, I guess its trying to update via wifi and is eating my monthly traffic. I
  guess it''s because of modifications I''ve made. how can I restore the original
  files and try to update it. (not factory settings)
