message: 'Thank you very much. It worked well on the second try and finally I get
  rid of that creepy screensaver.

  It was most helpful to follow suggestions 1 and 2 by Charlie (#post 38). Do not
  forget to change directory to the one where update_jailbreak_0.5_k3w_install.bin
  file is before you run a script.


  Awesome, Thanks again guys!!!!'
