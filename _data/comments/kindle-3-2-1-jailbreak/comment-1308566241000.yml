message: "No one of the JB worked yet on my K3w. Just to double check again: \nI have\
  \ a 3.2 FW (572340009) non-add version. \nDid also a factory reset, just to be clean.\n\
  Restarted and applied the JB for 3.1, (..04_kw3..), fails with U006.\nIs this the\
  \ right JB to apply for 3.2?\nTried the 3.2.1 JB (..05_kw3..) even shell assisted\
  \ because the timing, no luck either.\nWhich JB version should I keep trying?\n\
  Thanks!"
