  3. I think it gives more than one Build of 3.2.1. The Build 576290015 can't probably
  jailbreak. I tested it with all tipps there listed and really nothing will work.
  Can anybody tell me the Buildnumber of his jailbreaked 3.2.1? Have it a different
  Buildnumber? It's the number in parentheses after the 3.2.1.
