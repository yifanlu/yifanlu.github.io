message: I have a kindle 3.2.1 without special offers and am very happy with Yifan's
  jailbreak.  The only thing I had problems with was getting it installed, and after
  I realized my mistake it was very simple to add this jb.  For those of you who are
  having trouble getting it to work make sure that you unplug the usb cord from both
  the kindle and your computer!!!  Even though this step is in caps in the instructions,
  I failed to take heed of it for about 8 tries.  So learn from this fool's mistake
  and make sure that the cord is unplugged from both computer and kindle when it is
  restarting.
