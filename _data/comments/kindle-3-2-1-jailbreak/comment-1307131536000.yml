message: Clearly I represent a minority, but I have the ad-supported Kindle, love
  the ads (one-dollar Audible credits?  Yes, please.) AND want to jailbreak it.  Mostly,
  I want to play Infocom games on my Kindle, but I imagine that most Kindle with Special
  Offers users who want to jailbreak are just trying to get rid of the ads.
