message: 'Just wonder, if I buy a Kindle DX Graphite will I be able to get the 3.0+
  firmware on it? I just wonder as it looks like amazon will not release the kindle
  3 features to the Kindle DX (Which is wierd as its 3 times more expensive :S) I
  will use it for viewing programming PDF books so good PDF support is a must and
  from what I understand the Kindle 3 supports it much better than the Kindle DX Graphite
  after getting updates, but I want the big screen!


  Hope you can answer this while my brother is in the states so he can buy one for
  me if this is possible :)'
