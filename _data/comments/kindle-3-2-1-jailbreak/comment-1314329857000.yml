message: I intalled this jalbreak, but does it supposed to solve the "create a new
  collection" problem? Because mine still stayed gray after this process. I did everything
  as told I got the thick at the end of install. I think mine is blacklisted because
  my girlfriend ordered one from amazon and they sent her two, but we could only register
  one of them... I was trying to find the solution to solve the grayed out options
  problem but still nothing... Anybody ANY ideas??????
