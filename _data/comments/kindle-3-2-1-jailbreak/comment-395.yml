  3) While the Kindle is starting up, PLUG IN THE USB CABLE IN THE KINDLE AND THE
  COMPUTER


  Does that mean when it says "Wait while your Kindle starts" or when you see the
  loading bar?


  Also, once you load up the file onto the Kindle, do you disconnect it as soon as
  it''s done copying?'
