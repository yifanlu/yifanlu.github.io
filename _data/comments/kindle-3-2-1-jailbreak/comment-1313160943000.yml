message: "Great work that you're doing there! Somehow I got this kindle with a broken\
  \ screen, so I wonder how that nice piece of hardware could be used without the\
  \ screen. \nIt's still useful as an mp3 player, but with only AltSpace and AltF\
  \ there is not a lot of options. and an mp3 player with wifi and potential 3g etc..\
  \ could be much more useful. \n\nIt would be great to repurpose the kindle (maybe\
  \ with texttospeech output) and be able to use it as a internet radio or as such.\
  \ any ideas?"
