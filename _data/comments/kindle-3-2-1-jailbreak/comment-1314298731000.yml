message: "I had a kindle 3 with version 3.1 on it and I had to send it back because\
  \ of the screen freeze failure. Now the new one they have shipped me as a replacement\
  \ is 3.2.1 (576290015). \n\nI really want to be able to customize the screensaver,\
  \ but I can't get the jb to work.\n\nI have tried renaming the documents and system\
  \ folders with the wireless turned off. I do a restart, hook it to the usb while\
  \ its booting up, copy over the bin file, disconnect. In my menus the option to\
  \ update is always grayed out, so I have restarted it. I was getting an error 3\
  \ or nothing happened at all. Either way, its not working.\n\nSuggestions?"
