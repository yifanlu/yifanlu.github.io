message: 'It worked for me for the first time!


  I disabled wifi right after unpacking it. I followed the instruction and when I
  had reached the phase of restart, I connected the USB cable immediately after the
  notification of restart. I had to wait until the system came up and it showed the
  USB connection active screen, then I copied only the bin file into the root of opening
  explorer window.

  Couple of minutes elapsed, then finally it displayed the check mark!


  Thanks, Yifan!'
