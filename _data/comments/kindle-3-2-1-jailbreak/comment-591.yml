message: 'Hey Mr. Lu. It worked for me! I was so glad! but then I registered my kindle,
  shopped on the kindle store for a bit. Then BAM! I put my phone into sleep and the
  ads come back again! the LinkSS folder still exists and custom screensavers exist
  inside the screensaver folder, but they won''t display anymore like they used to
  before I registered my kindle.


  Any thoughts?

  Thanks
