message: 'The jailbreak may be for the Kindle with special offers but it doesn''t
  seem to work on my 3 day old Kindle Keyboard (3) 3.2.1 WiFi/3G reader.  I run the
  correct break according to your docs and am told the install is successful but the
  ads stay there.  I also tried running a screensaver hack after the break but it
  fails and the ads are still there.  Any ideas?  (beside telling me where to stick
  my Kindle, I mean)  :-)


  I really don''t mind the adverts but thought it might be nice to put  my own custom
  screensaver on board, just for a wheeze.


  Thanks for your time and efforts on behalf of we Kindle owners.'
