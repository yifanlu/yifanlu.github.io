message: Hi. First of all, I would like to thank you for everything you've done for
  all of us here. :) You've dedicated your time and effort to create this programs/codes
  for everyone. I wish I was as savvy with codes as you are so I could also do the
  same thing. :) By the way, is there any way that you'll release a jailbreaker for
  those Kindle with special offers? I bought one without special offers for $145 but
  when it broke, the new one they sent as replacement was a Kindle with special offers.
  &gt;.&lt; I couldn&#039;t bring myself to call them again and complain since they
  already replaced it so I&#039;m trying other options. Sorry if I&#039;m pushing
  my luck a bit by posting this. I hope I don&#039;t offend you or anything. Thank
  you and God bless!
