message: "It worked great! I have a Kindle 3 Wifi w/o special offers. The jailbreak\
  \ went smooth and took 5 minutes tops. I then used the screensaver hacks that were\
  \ released before and they worked just as they're supposed to. \n\nThank you so\
  \ much! My friend and I each bought Kindle at the same time recently, my FW updated\
  \ and his didn't and I have been so jealous of his custom screensavers. Thanks a\
  \ lot for releasing this, I really appreciate it!"
