message: 'Can you tell me where to download a backup of 3.1 rootfs.img?  Also, does
  the kindle_update_tool.py attached to this Jailbreak download have the â€“fb option
  that I will need for the downgrade, and how would I go about putting the 3.1 rootfs.img
  in the update file?  I tried this several times with my Kindle 3.2.1 3G and it never
  worked.  I read all of the comments and tried all the tips.  I saw in comment 87,
  you said how to downgrade to 3.1.  I think this would be my best option, as I would
  also like to install the English version of Duokon so I can reflow text in PDFs.
  I also want to fix the linking in the web browser once I jailbreak it (right now
  none of the links set to open in a new tab or window will open at all, even in the
  same window).


  If you could make this downgrade file (3.2.1 to 3.1.) so I could just copy it over
  to the kindle, I would greatly appreciate it! If not, a walk through of the process
  would also be very helpful.  Thank you so much!'
