message: 'Hello,  I am having trouble with my kindle 3g+wifi 3.2.1 us


  After much reading I feel like my problem is from trying to jailbreak too many times.   I
  have had this kindle for around a year, when i first got it I jailbroke it very
  simply and installed the screensaver hack so i could get my own screensavers.  It
  was all soooo easy.  Now today I decided to download a book off of amazon.com and
  registered my kindle, downloaded my book, and then found along with my book and
  registration I got a bunch of annoying Adds.  Proceeded to look online for a fix.  Used
  this http://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2011/11/30/how-to-get-rid-of-kindle-ads-and-special-offers-without-paying-extra/
  and it seemed to work, although I never could find the system folder so i just added
  the .assets part to the root.  And it removed the adds YEAH!... then my problems
  began.


  So at this point I have restored to factory,got rid of the adds, and now want to
  reinstall my screen saver hack.  Alas to no avail.  Tried to instal jailbreak, failed
  with error u006, ok expected that, but then get error u007 when trying to instal
  ss hack.  after many other jailbreak attempts and restores and restarts, nothing
  I am trying to install works.  Reading has only led me to believe I should have
  at some point uninstalled the updates to bring me back to somewhere that I am now
  unable to find.  If anyone can help me reset my kindle to back in the box settings
  I would greatly appreciate it.  Also I hope this can be a warning for someone who
  unknowingly might end up here.  ONE great news though is my although my kindle is
  no longer jailbroke, I can still restore to factory settings and get boring lame
  screensavers and it still works.  I''ll end in saying Thank you in advance for all
  the help I hope I may receive and beware if fooling with things you dont understand
  lol.'
