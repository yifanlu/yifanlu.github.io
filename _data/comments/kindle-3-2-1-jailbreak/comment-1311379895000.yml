message: I attempted this several times tonight. It worked, but de-registered my Kindle
  from Amazon. So when I re-registered, all of my screensavers disappeared. Now back
  to normal, boring screensavers. When I plug my Kindle up to my computer it is still
  showing that I have the screensavers, but they aren't working anymore. I have restarted
  several times as well and nothing has changed. Thanks anyway. =)
