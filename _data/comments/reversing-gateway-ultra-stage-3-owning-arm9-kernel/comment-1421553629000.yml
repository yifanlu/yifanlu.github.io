message: Yes actually you are taking business away from gateway. It is a very simple
  logic. They worked hard for it and they deserve the money. Let's say someone release
  a cfw out of it, no one buys Gw anymore. No more emunand support from that point
  onwards. No one is motivated to do the update. If you want to share something, make
  sure it is your own work. It will be better if you manage to write your own exploit
  and release it. You are basically stealing other people's work(and study some code
  here and there), and release it like you are a God. Yes you reverse engineered it,
  so? What difference does it makes you away from Govanify? Nope, just another attention
  seeker that has more technical skill, I guess.
