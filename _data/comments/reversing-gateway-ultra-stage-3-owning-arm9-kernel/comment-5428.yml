message: 'lol to the folks trying to defend Gateway. Some try and argue Gateway somehow
  deserves protection because it was they who enabled homebrew/hacking (and piracy
  for those inclined to go that route) on the 3DS.


  But ye'' all forget that Gateway only exists because people refused to release or
  otherwise document known exploits in this system. So eventually someone sells out
  to someone else and creates a company called "Gateway" and holds a monopoly on the
  hacking scene. Unlike the PSP Scene, the 3DS scene early on was full of people who
  didn''t want to share knowledge/exploits of this system. So eventually something
  gets leaks info to someone else for a price and this was the end result.


  This is what happens when information/knowledge is withheld. Bad actors in the scene
  will find a way to get this information without the rest getting it and creates
  a business model around it. There was absolutely no reasion why the things being
  done on the 3DS now can''t be done without a flashcart. This isn''t the days of
  the DS/DS LIte where there wasn''t really a operating system to speak of on the
  console. The 3DS has the means of running games/software without an additional game
  cartridge and yet somehow even though it''s fully hacked we are still stuck to using
  a flashcart as our entry point? Come the ***k on. Stop defending them. The WiiU
  scene is just as bad or even worse. I would not surprised if that console got trapped
  into the same situation the 3DS is right now.


  I for one support what yifanlu has done and hope to see him work more on this in
  the future when he gets the time to do so! :D'
