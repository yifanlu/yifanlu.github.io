  Guess wisdom and intelligence are two very different things.  It almost hurts
  me to see someone so smart appeal to pure emotions due to being tricked by
  substandard lies that fall apart as soon as anyone actually pokes at it.  Look
  at the sheer destruction of property the left has done just because someone
  they don't like was elected.  The left has caused more destruction in the last
  2 years than any right leaning group.  The most the Tea party did was kill a
  few fish by dumping some crap off of the side of a ship.
