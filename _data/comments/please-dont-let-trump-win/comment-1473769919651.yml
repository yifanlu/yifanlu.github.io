message: "I'm disappointed. You endorse the person behind \"Correct The Record.\" -- The organization that is paid to argue with Trump supporters online. The media is also pushing towards her, I noticed during the DNC when they were covering up the walk out and protests outside. She is 1984: The Candidate.\r\n\r\nI don't see what you're hoping for though. The economy is going to crash again (far worse than last time) it is ineVITAble. Prolonging it a few more years is all any president can do at this point."
