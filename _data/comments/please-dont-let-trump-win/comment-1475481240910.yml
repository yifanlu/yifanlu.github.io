message: "You don't have to look to far. Look at Germany and France. If you don't want the same mess happening to America, vote for Trump. \r\nDemocrats are good people but they don't deal with real issues properly. By the time these issues fester, it'll be all too late. \r\n\r\nVote for our great free country! Vote Trump!"
