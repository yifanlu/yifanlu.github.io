  You've downplayed Hillary's faults and pushed up Trump's to a ridiculous
  degree, using scare mongering, emotional pleas and unsourced claims in a
  shitty attempt to lend your writing credibility. You make me sick, not so much
  for voting Hillary, lord knows I'd be a very angry man if I hated everyone who
  did that, but for actually bothering to write all of this that basically boils
  down to "Don't vote Trump because he's a bully :(". This is fucking
  Tumblr-tier writing and you know it.
