  Don't let Hillary win. She is a liar. She will increase taxes. She will not do
  anything to take care of US citizens. I am an immigrant who became a citizen
  and I am voting for Trump. He will make America great again, because as of now
  it is not the greatest country of the world because of Obama. Let the
  Republican Party rule for 4 years and then we can see if things will be
  better. If Hillary wins, there will be absolutely no change. We all want
  change. I bet who ever wrote this haven't even heard of Hillary's evil side!!!
