message: "I watched an episode of futurama a month ago, which looked a lot like donald trumps campaign (and what might happen when he wins), it was funny/scary to see and definitely interesting(season 9 episode 3). \r\n\r\np.s. Just be glad you can still write this article before trump had the chance to call bill gates to shut down the internet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rFHwGTOYxc)."
