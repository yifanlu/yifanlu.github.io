  See, here's the thing.  The left has had plenty of times to listen to the
  right's concerns; they just never gave a shit.  Mitt Romney, the cuckiest of
  all the recent candidates from the right, a Mormon who was scared of being
  called racist, tried to voice the concerns of the traditionalist and got
  called a Nazi on the Daily Show.  I think the Left just lost a game of The Boy
  who Cried Nazi and now doesn't want to take responsibility for their actions. 
  It's hilarious.
