  Yifan I agree but I am afraid that it won't matter. I can't believe that what
  started out as a joke (the idea of someone like Trump running for president)
  has snowballed into this nightmare of pending doom for our great Country. Like
  Hitler rallying the Aryan blonde blue-eyed Nazi's to assault the Jews, Trump
  is a con-man who knows the words to incite, unite &amp; empower one group of
  men by blaming another. Hitler was able to fool &amp; brainwash the Aryan
  race, even though he was not blond &amp; blue-eyed himself. Trump dons a 
  "good-ol'boy" red baseball cap &amp; spouts &amp; tweets a bunch of racist
  &amp; sexist remarks &amp; promises, and this entitled billionaire narcissus
  cons &amp; brainwashes the non-college uneducated white males who blindly
  believe he cares about them and will somehow be their savior. But that is not
  who he is. Actions speak louder than words. Trump brags all sorts of
  outrageous claims - but if we look at his actions - He is full of hot air.
  This man talks a big talk, but then he doesn't pay what he promises. He cheats
  people out of money that he contracted to pay them for good-faith work they
  did for him;  We hear of  Lawsuits from builders that he cheated, Class action
  federal Lawsuits from his now-defunct "University", sexual lawsuits;  He
  doesn't pay federal taxes like the rest of us hard working non-billionaire
  Americans do, and brags it is because "he's smart";  He is a hypocritical 
  huge offender of outsourcing his products to other countries. (Trump products
  were manufactured in China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey, Slovenia,
  Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam &amp; South Korea) He has
  never been loyal to the USA, just to himself;  He brags of his business skills
  but all he does is default and has gone bankrupt over ....and over ...and over
  ...and over... and over....  Well when the wall never gets built (Trump said
  that the border would cost $12 billion, when in reality, experts have
  estimated the 35 to 55-foot wall to cost $25 billion, and after seven years it
  would exceed that number to maintain it.) and he starts defaulting on his
  promises like is his nature to do, will America smarten up and see the con? Or
  will he bankrupt once more....?
