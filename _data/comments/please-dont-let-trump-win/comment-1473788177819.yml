He has never proposed any harmful policies to legal citizens (besides the harmful policies that harm *everyone* like trade tariffs).\r\n\r\nThis post is mostly stupid and is merely showing your preference for the facade of politicians than the unfiltered businessman. I prefer the evil I can see than the lying evil always in hiding."
