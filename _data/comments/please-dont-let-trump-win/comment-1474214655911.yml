message: "@tmtvl\r\nSupressed by whom, congress? That is assuming congress will look drastically different from now. The conservatives who for years dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to sabotage Pres. Obama would predictably turn into doormats if Trump would be his successor. Unless a collective effort would be made to vote him out of office. I can imagine not everyone in the GOP appreciated how Trump treated his co-runners in the republican party. \"Deplorable\" *is* an apt description of such behaviour."
