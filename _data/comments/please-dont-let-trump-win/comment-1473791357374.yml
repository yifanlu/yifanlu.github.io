message: "For those who thinks that just illegal immigrants will suffer, this is not real what will going to happen. As soon as you start to hate illegal immigrants it start to create the idea that all immigrants are bad! And everyone that doesn't look or sound like an american are bad. How can you know if someone is legal or illegal? The xenophobia is the problem, and Trump clearly show how he hates everything and everyone that it's not pure american. He is what you're looking for, unless you're racist, xenophobic, a birther and generally stupid.\r\n\r\nYou're not better than anyone else, immigrants, legal or illegal are not here to steal your job and get free money without paying taxes. People like Trump hires illegal immigrants because they want to save money, not to give money to the workers. If you want to get your money back, start to accept shit paid jobs. No american wants to clean a bathroom or scrub pots and ban in the restaurant basement, stop crying about \"they stole our jobs!\", it was not your job to start with, it was a vacant spot.\r\n\r\nWork, pay your taxes, pray to your God, but be nice, people deserve respect and to support an horrible, terrible human being will hurt this country more than 4 more years of \"Obama\". Remember, the economy was horrible before Obama, you just don't want to accept that because you can not have a black person smarter and better than you.\r\n\r\n2016 people, just in time to become a better person.\r\n\r\nDON'T VOTE FOR TRUMP!"
