  For those who say as long as your legal you don't have anything to worry about
  you are naive, ignorant, racist, in denial or just plain stupid. No one is
  going look at my skin tone and assume I'm a U.S. citizen (which I am.) Brown
  people like me will be having to wear something  similar to what the Jews had
  to do during the Hitler era. Trump isn't a republican he is a narcissistic
  sociopathic capitalist that is only looking out for himself and his own
  family. Which is fine if you want to be a private businessman not the leader
  of the FREE world. For the working class white American; he would not spit on
  you if you were on fire. He will do nothing to help you but bring on World War
  lll and the draft because lord knows none of his family will go or has gone to
  war. The people that make me the angriest are the Latinos that are voting for
  him how many racist things does he have to say for you to get hey he is
  talking about you and your family not those other people. Get Smarter America
  I would rather vote for Sara Palin something I thought I would never say then
  Trump. He will get us all blown up over someone calling something not nice
  cause he doesn't deserve that!
