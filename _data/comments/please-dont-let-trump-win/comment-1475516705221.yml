message: "Yifan, come to germany, you're also welcome here. Every human has the right to live his live in peace. \r\n@janeForTrump: What exactly happened in germany that doesnt happen all over the world and infinite times more often in the US? Most germans are supportive of Merkels decision and do their best to help all those people that fled the war. All that racism happening in germany is coming from a small but loud group, unable to even think and burping right-wing populist shit. Like Trump and all his supporters. Dont feel, use your brain!\r\n\r\nAnd for everyone worrying clinton will destroy whatever the rest of the world thinks of your country, you are wrong. Its already too late. You are the laughing stock of the world. Everyone asks how dumb and blind the americans can be. The once was \"leader of the free world\" is now nothing more than the people that vote for their own destruction."
