Oh wait, don't even answer to that question.\r\nI don't necessarily believe that he didn't satisfactorily explain Hilary's \"bad things\" compared to Trump's atrocity, but you're inseparably arguing for the wrong shit. The guy's got a list of things about how he'd rather make a coherent choice between the two supposed evil, and you're here bitching about how he's appealing to his \"supposed naivete\"against Trump.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a supporter of Trump or not, now THAT is some internet meme guy-tier, don't you think?"
