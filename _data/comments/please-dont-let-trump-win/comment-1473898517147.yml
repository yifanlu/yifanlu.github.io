message: "@Gen. Hombre\r\nWell, regarding Trump, I don't think he's too far of the mark, but he's wording it a bit loosely. Me, I don't know what Trump actually believes in. If he honestly believes torture should be used in war again, and whether he believes absolutely every muslim should be put in a \"muslim database\" like they were all criminals by default by virtue of their religion. I don't even know if he cares to reality-check his proposals and statements in light of what the US constitution says. But I do understand that these statements are NOTa \"spur of the moment\" kind of thing, especially if theres a dime to be made off of it.\r\n\r\nThe things he says, the very way he says them, and when he says them makes it clear to me what kind of message he wants to convey and to whom he has chosen to direct it. There are way too many strike-outs on this man for me to consider him innocent, especially when flirting with and making himself seem (within limits of plausible deniability) like a stray acolyte of the far-right. Something which of course gives them publicity and a chance to associate themselves with him and attract new blood into their ranks even should Trump himself chose to remain ambivalent on his relationship to them and the support he would receive from them in turn.  His weasel-like ability to shirk away, to just bail-and-reset businesses over and over seems to have been successfully carried over in this present endeavor of his. In this reality-show of an election his brand of crookedness is almost seen as a brand of authenticity in and of itself... ugh. \r\n\r\nI've heard Trump say that Clinton is divisive, and then present himself as the anti-thesis of that. I wonder if his model of \"unity\" is \"white unity\" in a white ethno-state, like William Johnson of AFP envisions? Johnson, who was drafted (and then eliminated) as a Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention. How did that happen? Was this one on Donald Trump, or his campaign staff? Johnson once proposed to repeal the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, clarifying that: “No person shall be a citizen of the United States unless he is a non-Hispanic white of the European race…Only citizens shall have the right and privilege to reside permanently in the United States.” This all concerns a bit more people than just your illegal immigrants, don't y'all think?  Of course, maybe he doesn't know all the White Separatist politicians backing him. Maybe he's just so very open minded about it all he thinks of it as him having \"broad appeal\". I personally think Trump would be very pleased if he could make a penny out of this election business and cares not a bit for how it affects the country in terms of racial relations, or otherwise. I mean if all goes to hell he could still make a buck on his brand of \"master of dissent\" he's got going on with the alt-right and the Breitbart company and make it all worthwhile anyways."
