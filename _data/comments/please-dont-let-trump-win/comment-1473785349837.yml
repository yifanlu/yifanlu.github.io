message: "Thank you, Yifan. As someone on the other side of the planet, the prospect of Trump as the US president is fucking scary, and it's mind-boggling to see people be so blatantly deaf and blind to everything he says and does. Moreso to see a country whose media will tie itself in a knot just to present both candidates as \"equal\".\r\n\r\nWhen even Auschwitz survivors like Irene Weiss can recognize the very specific brand of hate that Trump parades, it's time to reel it in. No, I'm not happy to see Hillary as the Democratic nominee, but I'll take \"business as usual\" over literal racial hatred and vocal nuclear threats for four years."
