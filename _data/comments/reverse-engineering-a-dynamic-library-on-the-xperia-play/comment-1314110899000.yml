message: Great findings. Especially the last tip on debugging. I do it even more primitive.
  I disassemble so library using IDA Pro. Then I find the place where I would like
  to change the code. Since I am using evaluation version I am not allowed to save
  my changes. So I open the same library using HEX editor and do the changes. I don't
  know if this even works. Because I haven't done any useful patching yet. What do
  you think? Will hexedited library still work? Is there some checksums in ELF file
  that should be recalculated?
