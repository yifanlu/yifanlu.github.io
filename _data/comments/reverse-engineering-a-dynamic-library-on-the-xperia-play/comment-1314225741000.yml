  (: I am trying to make MinecraftPE look-around-controls work on my Nexus One. It
  seems that MPE uses the code from SonyErricsson tutorial to handle touch events
  (source code - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1045374). The thing
  is that this code handles both - touchscreen and xperias touchpad events. I think
  somewhere MPE just checks if the event is from touchscreen and then it discards
  it. I want to change this behaviour obviously. (:


  Anyways, you mentioned that opcode for NOP is 00 00 A0 E1. I also found that its
  00 BF. Do you know what is the difference between these two?


  And one more thing, do you know what are the commands ITE HI or ITE NE for? I cant
  really find reference for them and I see these two quite often.'
