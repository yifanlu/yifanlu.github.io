message: "Reading stuff like st4rk's post and the post about stage 1 gives me this weird enlightenment shivers I get when I watch and learn all about the minuscule but significant details that resulted in Hitler's eventual downfall.\r\n\r\nMakes me wish I started learning in-depth cryptanalysys and security penetration when I was a student. I was just a script kiddie who tore down systems with SQL injections,  known Wordpress exploits, and simple packet manipulations. Hey, I'm just an Information Systems developer who uses C# and Java and not some hardware engineer where assembly is too high-level already hahaha.\r\n\r\nSeeing all this low-level stuff happen makes me, simply, amazed.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!"
