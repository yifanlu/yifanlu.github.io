  To bad you stopped with Phpretro! It didn''t work for me very well, when I entered
  my IP at the setup, I get to localhost and it says: http://MYIP/MYIP/MYIP/MYIP/MYIP
  etc. But I''ll try it soon, a tutorials says I have to change the site in config.php.


  But you''re right, getting caught isn''t fun. How many did it cost you?
