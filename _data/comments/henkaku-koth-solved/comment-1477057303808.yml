message: "Less than 3 months to reverse #HENkaku masterpiece  is just amazing!\r\n\r\nAFAIK @hexkyz  and @St4rkDev used another approach than the proposed by you. \r\n\r\nNow that #HENkaku has been solved the new version  will not include any obfuscation?\r\n\r\n@St4rkDev mentions \"Trust Zone\" and \"Security Core\"  but the encrypted payload bypassed them or apply some patch ?\r\n\r\nSo many questions only time will tell.\r\n\r\nThanks again to you and the rest of the Molecule Team for your hard work!"
