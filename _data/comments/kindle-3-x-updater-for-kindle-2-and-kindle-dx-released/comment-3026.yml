message: Like qwas I'm trying to restore a Kindle DX from 3.2.1 back to 2.5.8.  I
  put the "update_restore-os.bin" in the root and went to Menu/Settings/Update but
  then it ended up with a loop and updating over and over.  I ended up in Recovery
  Mode and can now connect the Kindle to the PC.  The Kindle directory is blank.  Do
  I need the rootfs.img on the Kindle as well as the update_restore-os.bin?
