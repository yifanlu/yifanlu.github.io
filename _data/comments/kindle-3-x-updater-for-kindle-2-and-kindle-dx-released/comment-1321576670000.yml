  There is a post in Chinese about this: http://www.hi-pda.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=864068&extra=page%3D1


  You don''t need to uninstall 3.2.1 to install duokan. Just use the latest duokan
  release for DXG (release on May 20). Copy DK_system, DK_documents,DK_pictures and
  emergency.sh into your kindle root directory, and restart your kindle. You may need
  to restart your DXG several times until the Duokan startup screen shows up.

  The file emergency.sh can be downloaded here: http://www.hi-pda.com/forum/attachment.php?aid=982889'
