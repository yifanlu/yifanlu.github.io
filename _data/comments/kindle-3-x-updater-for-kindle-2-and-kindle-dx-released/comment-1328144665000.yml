message: 'One questions, since screen resolution of K3 and Kindle DXG are different
  (800x600 vs. 1200x824). Will if affect the quality of display. Does the 3.2 firmware
  support the resolution of DXG (apparently it does, how?) just feel weird.

  Anyway, it is great work that you are doing. Thank you.'
