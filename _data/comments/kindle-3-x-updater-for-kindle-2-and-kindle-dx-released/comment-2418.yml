message: "Dear all,\nHave the same Problem as others. My Kindle Wi-Fi has version\
  \ 3.3, and so the program is not working â€“ unfortunately :-(\n\nI was soooooooooooooo\
  \ happy when I saw the blog and that some kind people did work to get an improvement\
  \ that Amazon is not willing to do for the Kindle DX customers - THANSK to them\
  \ (also if unfortuatnely I have the wrong version).\n\nDoes any workaround exist\
  \ for people who have a Kindle Wi-Fi 3.3? \nOr a place to get the needed files?\n\
  \nAny input is welcome - Thanks in advance :-)\n\na.w.rom@email.de\n\nKind regards\n\
