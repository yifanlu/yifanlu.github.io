message: "Regarding the \"error 0003\" mentioned above (post #5). I had the same problem.\
  \ After looking at the log file requested by Yifan Lu I've realized that the script\
  \ crashed because there wasn't enough space on the hard drive. Here's the make-backup.log:\n\
  \nota_install: I def:make-backup::checking for enough free space to continue\nota_install:\
  \ E def:make-backup::not enough free space to create a backup package. You need\
  \ at least 900MB to continue.\nsystem: I 1-make-backup.ffs:def:drawing: eips 19\
  \ 38 \"You need 450MB of free space.\" \n\nSo, I temporarily moved to my computer\
  \ all of my documents, and the script now works. Note: I initially had like 1.2GB\
  \ of free space. So I did not expect this to be an issue."
