message: 'Hello, apparently nobody was hit by unability to install k3 hacks on kDXG,
  or it is too "dummy" question for gurus :-)

  My (it seems that working) solution was to take an older update, one in version
  for k3g and one for KDXG and compare them. The result was difference just in one
  byte (part of SN. check).

  By editing this byte in .bin file (fonts, screensaver, usbnet, language pack, launchpad,
  TTS) I''ve enabled installing k3g package on updated KDXG - so now I have DXG speaking
  czech including TTS :-)

  Only problem I have with updated firmware is PDF viewer crashing on large PDFs (40MB+),
  unfortunately these technical books were exactly the reason, why I bought DXG.'
