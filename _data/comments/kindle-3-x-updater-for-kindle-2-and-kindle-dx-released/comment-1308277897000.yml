message: I did this, and it all seemed to work fine, but it broke all my active content.
  I did it mostly so I could get mibbit to work on my kindle 2. I restored to factory
  defaults, and tried to download archived items again. It claimed to be downloading
  them, but they simply don't appear. Is there any fix for this? I rather like Triple
  Town.
