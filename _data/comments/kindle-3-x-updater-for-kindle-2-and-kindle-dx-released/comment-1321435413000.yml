message: "Hi,\nThanks for this, I have updated my DX graphite, and it works pretty\
  \ good. Especially improved is the browser!\nFYI there are a few problems:\n- Audio\
  \ books now play with distinct background noise, such that this feature becomes\
  \ almost unusable (I know this is a known bug)\n- Large PDFs that contain a lot\
  \ of scanned content, which used to open within seconds on the old DX software,\
  \ now don't. Takes forever and the only way I can move on is by restarting.\n\n\
  Because of this second fault, I would like to reinstall Duokan, which was what I\
  \ used for PDFs before (and which also has better music player)- it stopped working\
  \ after the upgrade - but have been unable to install that, or Duokan lite - any\
  \ ideas? I got the feeling it was because I need to uninstall jailbreak - is this\
  \ possible without uninstalling 3.2.1? \n\nThanks again,\ntheWoosh"
