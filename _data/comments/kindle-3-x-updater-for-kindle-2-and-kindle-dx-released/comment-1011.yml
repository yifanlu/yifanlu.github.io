message: "Thanks! I encountered some issue with my dxg upgrade, however it is very\
  \ likely to be the problem of my dxg. \n\nI followed your instructions and upgraded\
  \ my dxg to 3.2.1. Then I used the jailbreak file for DXG to jailbreak it and installed\
  \ fonthack. Everything seamed OK until I opened the browser, the screen became fuzzy.\
  \ The text is almost unreadable. I had to press the menu key to return to the home\
  \ screen, waited for a few minutes before pressing the menu and back keys to refresh\
  \ screen, to get the screen return normal. \nI first thought it was the problem\
  \ of the upgrade, but the problem persisted after I restored to 2.5.8."
