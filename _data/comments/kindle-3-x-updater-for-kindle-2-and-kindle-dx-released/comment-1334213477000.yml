message: "hi,\ni installed a dxg 3.2.1 and its working for me, albeit with  frustrating\
  \  bugs like:\n\n    After using for an hour or so and  highlighting in pdf it may\
  \ hang.It seems that on using pdf and highlighting makes the system unstable.\n\
  \    once it hangs on a pdf, we cant open any other document, only restart helps.If\
  \ we try opening a pdf again while its on  a hang, it will show a message \"pdf\
  \ contains features not  supported by your kindle\"\noccasionally it forgets bookmarks\
  \ and notes in pdf docs.\n    audio is noisy"
