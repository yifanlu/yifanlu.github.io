message: I'm having the same problem the create_update_3.1.bin, it does not work on
  3.3 firmware, as reported by Ravi the update menu option appears unavailable and
  then upon reconnecting kindle 3 to the usb, I can see that the updater file has
  been removed. I was so excited about getting that DX of mine updated. I do hope
  you come up with an updater that works for the 3.3 software. I appreciate your effort
  and making this information available. Thanks!
