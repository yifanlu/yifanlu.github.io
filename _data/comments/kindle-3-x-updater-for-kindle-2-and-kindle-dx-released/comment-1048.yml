  \ â€” November 5, 2011 @ 5:05 am\"\n\nI can also confirm that the create_update_3.1.bin\
  \ does not work on 3.3 firmware (running on my Kindle 3 wifi).   When I copy over\
  \ the file along with the rootfs.img, the update menu option is not available. \
  \ When I reconnect the USB, the create_update file has been removed from the device.\
  \  \n\nAny solutions for this?  \n\nThanks!\n\nRavi"
