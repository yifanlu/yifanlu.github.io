message: "Hello Mr. Yifan Lu,\nI own a U.S Kindle 3 wifi+3G (v3.1) and a U.S. Kindle\
  \ DX Graphite (v2.5.8). I went through all the steps and your updater worked flawlessly!!!\
  \ Thank you very, very much.\n\nObservations:\n1. No problems, no errors, no hiccups\
  \ in the procedure. Even hacks from Kindle 3, which presently do not exist for Kindle\
  \ DX, transfered well and are working (\"keybru\" &amp; \"physkeyb\", which add\
  \ support for special national characters). Over that, on freshly updated Kindle\
  \ DX, I installed the Kindle DX version of \"launcher\" and \"FBkindle\" (FBreader\
  \ port for Kindle). All works great (with one small reserve described in line 6.).\n\
  2. Reading Kindle books is much better due to better rendering of fonts (especially\
  \ visible on italics) and due to more flexible settings (line spacing).\n3. Reading\
  \ PDF books is SO, SO much better due to flexible settings(adjustable darkness)and\
  \ due to the possibility to move around the text, to use built-in dictionary, and\
  \ to add higlights/notes. The font rendering seems improved as well.\n4. Kindle\
  \ DX, in general, feels slower and laggier than Kindle 3. If it's due to the update\
  \ I can't tell, since I updated it the same day I got it from Amazon. But sometimes,\
  \ when turned off, it takes a second or two for it to go to sleep. When turned back\
  \ on, it may take up to 15 seconds to wake up. Launching FBkindle can take that\
  \ long as well. Opening books, going to the Home screen and browsing through menus\
  \ is laggier than on Kindle 3. And all that with only a few books on the flash drive.\n\
  5. Web browser is SO much better, it renders the webpages truethfully and the size\
  \ and resolution of the display make up for a passable browsing and reading experience.\
  \ But naturally, it does not come any close to web brosing on a smartphone or a\
  \ tablet and thus constitutes only an emergency solution (i.e. in a foreign country\
  \ thanks to its free 3G connectivity worldwide).\n6. The only weird behavior I noticed\
  \ is with the web browser. When browsing, lines of what appears like command line\
  \ instructions/logging messages flash over the content of the screen, revealing\
  \ what's going on \"under the hood\". This sometimes goes on for a while even when\
  \ switching to a Home screen or to a book. In an extreme case, the Kindle needs\
  \ to be restarted for it to go away. Factory reset does not remove this. I don't\
  \ know whether this is related, but when browsing, strange folders appear in the\
  \ root of the Kindle USB drive. Any ideas? \n\nI posted some pictures here: http://comptran.wz.cz/kindle.htm.\
  \ The last three pics document the phenomenon described in line 6.\n\nLastly, little\
  \ off topic note: If you compare the two Kindles side by side, the eInk display\
  \ on Kindle DX Graphite is visibly crispier. The white is whiter, black is blacker,\
  \ i.e. overall better contrast and reading experience. The slightly finer resolution\
  \ of Kindle 3 display poses no real advantage and is perceivable only when closely\
  \ inspecting the individual characters.\n\nOnce again, thank you for the great work!!!\
  \ You prevented my disappointment with Kindle DX, which otherwise would have been\
  \ inevitable."
