This was a quick one hour project. I took [ASCIIMan](/p/asciiman), and chopped up and rearranged the code to be a Pong game. Introducing [JoshPong](/p/joshpong), less of a Pong game, more of a demo of the ASCIIMan engine, and Josh library. I know there's a big bug in Josh that prevents loading the native DLL, so make sure you read the temporary work-around posted on the download page.
