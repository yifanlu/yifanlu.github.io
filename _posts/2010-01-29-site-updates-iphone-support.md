I finally took some time from my busy schedule and made some changes to the site.



	
  1. I stopped being cheap and finally bought www.yifanlu.com

	
  2. Thanks to WPTouch, the site can be viewed on the iPhone & Android with ease

	
  3. Added a contact form

	
  4. Made tweaks here and there in the designs, fixed some typos & style errors


Also, quick update: I'm still working on that Facebook app, with all the homework and exams, I barely have any free time, however, here's some screens on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2034334&id=1299785766&l=921f5309f0).
