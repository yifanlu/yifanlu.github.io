I didn't plan to do any more Kindle stuff for a while, but when I made a recovery kernel (prevents your Kindle from bricking) for the Kindle 2/DX as part of [my 3.X installer](/p/kindleupdater), many asked for a similar protective thing on newer Kindles. Well, [here it is](/p/kindle-custom-kernel).

For now it's just a kernel with recovery features (export entire filesystem without password or serial port and install custom recovery packages), but maybe if I have the time, one day, I will make it a full custom kernel with additional features or something.
