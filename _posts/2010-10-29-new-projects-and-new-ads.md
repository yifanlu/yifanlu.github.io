Remember the two scripts I've posted earlier in the week? Well, I finally have the time to formally insert them into the database, so here they are:

[/p/psn_update_finder](/p/psn_update_finder)

[/p/facetime_surveillance](/p/facetime_surveillance)

Also, I've finally had it with Google Adsense. They banned me for no legitimate reason. Google said that my PSN Update Finder (and "maybe other similar pages") was "in violation of our program policies". After re-reading their policies, I still don't know which policy I supposedly broke, and emailing them only got a reply that is the same message. Therefore, I'm now trying out new ad networks, seeing which is the fastest, most non-intrusive, and the most relevant. If you see any intrusive ads or malware ads, please send me an email and I will take care of it. Thanks.
