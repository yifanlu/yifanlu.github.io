[![Vita NAND Pinout](/images/2013/12/vita_nand_pinout.jpg)](/images/2013/12/vita_nand_pinout.jpg)

As promised, here's the pinout for the Vita's eMMC (NAND). Don't be fooled by the picture; the size of the resistors are TINY. Plus, if you noticed, half the traces are almost hugging the shield base (which is [pretty hard to remove](/2013/12/18/removing-the-cpu-and-nand-from-psvita/) without disturbing the resistors). I hope I can find a better way to dump the eMMC than soldering to these points. It's doubtful that they are exposed elsewhere as I've checked every unfilled pad on both sides of the board. Wish me luck...

To get an idea of the size of the resistors, I've placed a 0.7mm pencil lead next to them.
