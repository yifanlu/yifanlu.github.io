I almost forgot about this.

This project was written purely out of my boredom in class. I wanted to learn 1) Javascript, 2) jQuery, 3) JSON, and 4) more Ajax, so I decided to write this simple word search solver. The "backend" (puzzle solving algorithm) is written in PHP not because I didn't know how to write it in Javascript (ok, maybe it's because of that),  but because I wanted to try out JSON by allowing PHP to pass the puzzle solutions to Javascript. This word search solver has features such as: solving the puzzle live by highlighting the solution as you type, adding lists of words, removing words from list with delete key or double click, etc.

It's also very buggy, because as I stated, I wrote this in a few hours with zero knowledge of jQuery/Javascript.

Anyways, here's the site: [http://apps.yifan.lu/wss/](http://apps.yifan.lu/wss/) and the source: [/p/wss](/p/wss)
