I usually spend my free time building things or taking them apart. (These things are usually software.) However, this summer, I've decided to relax and take a break from all this computer stuff, leaving everything from programming to Twitter to [Party poker](http://ro.partypoker.com/) to you people. I have decided to "experience" one hundred different stories. What do I mean by that? I will read books, watch movies, play games, etc. One hundred in all. After each one, I will collect my thoughts and write a short review on it. If you're still interested, [let's go dive right into it](http://100stories.yifan.lu/welcome/).
