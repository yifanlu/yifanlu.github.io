My first Java project. In short, my goal is to map EVERY native Windows console function listed here: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682073(VS.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682073(VS.85).aspx) to Java via a C++ DLL, JNI, and Java. So far, what I have done is: text color/highlight and title. I'll work on this until I find something better to work on. You can follow development progress via Twitter: [https://twitter.com/projectjosh](https://twitter.com/projectjosh) and the source & binary will be released as soon as I can get a stable beta with at least half the functions.

Once this project is finished, you can easily make (Windows only) great console apps via Java. You can do advanced things like text color, background color, mouse events, cursor control, etc directly in the console.
