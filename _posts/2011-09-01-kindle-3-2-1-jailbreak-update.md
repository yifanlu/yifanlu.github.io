When I first released the Kindle 3.2.1 jailbreak, I called it "temporary." Although confusing to use and set up, it has gotten thousands of hits and reports of success. However, it was "temporary" because the method used depended on some precise timing and I had a better method that I was saving for Kindle 3.3. Now, I realize that 3.3 will never come, but will instead be 4.0 that will come with Kindle 4, and with a new hardware, everything doesn't matter. [Serge A. Levin](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1725629&postcount=151) has independently discovered a similar bug for what I was going to use on the 3.3 jailbreak, and I've asked him to release it because he deserves the credit for the work. If we're lucky, Amazon will fix the bug in a way that my similar plan for 3.3/4.0 will still work.<!-- more -->

(If you are already jailbroken, regardless of what version you're running, you don't need to download this. The actual jailbreak hasn't been updated, just the injection method.)

Also, if you think that the jailbreak didn't work, try installing a custom package anyways. I have fixed many people's "I can't get it working" by telling them that it's already jailbroken.

EDIT: It seems like there is some confusion so I'll clear this up. **Jailbreaking does NOT remove ads.**
