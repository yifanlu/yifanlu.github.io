KATY, Texas, Apr 01, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS) today announced it will be permanently closing it's doors at Yifan Lu. "The hardest part of my job is laying off employees. That and making games. Shit's hard, we should start doing that soon." commented EA CEO John Riccitiello in an earnings call following the announcement of the cuts. "It was tough having to get rid of such an awesome guy, but because of the drops of profits caused weak game sales (which was in correlation to the increase in the IQ of an average video game buyer), we had to make difficult decisions." Yifan Lu has been responsible for hit titles such as TBA, Coming Spring 2013, and Project Canceled.
