Thanks to work done almost entirely by **Netrix** (and also thanks to **SMOKE** for testing and modifications to the setup script), [Rejuvenate](/2015/06/14/rejuvenate-native-homebrew-for-psvita/) is now supported on both PSM Unity and PSM Unity for VitaTV.

As always, you can find downloads to the latest version [here](/p/rejuvenate/) as well as the source for [VitaDefiler](http://github.com/yifanlu/VitaDefiler) and [UVLoader](http://github.com/yifanlu/UVLoader) on GitHub.

### Installation


Just like before, run SETUP.bat and follow the directions. If you are using PSM+, be sure to follow the directions where you get PSM+. To use on VitaTV, install the client on your Vita and then move the memory card to the VitaTV. I hear that mr.gas will release a method for client installation that does not require a Vita to install. Follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gabaas1) for details on that when the time comes.



### Support


Support will be provided in [#vitadev](irc://irc.efnet.net/vitadev) on EFNet IRC. **Netrix**, who is responsible for the Unity port will be on there.

Enjoy and happy homebrewing!
