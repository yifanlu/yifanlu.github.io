Another quick half-hour script I wrote. This is an AppleScript that lets you use FaceTime as a video monitor. Just run the script in background, and whenever you want to see your house, just do a FaceTime call to your iMac and the script will accept it.

Assumptions:
1) Nobody else knows your Mac's FaceTime email. Make it secret, or people can spy on you by calling your email.
2) You haven't resized FaceTime. I'm lazy so, it closes FaceTime whenever the window size is 638 by 585.
