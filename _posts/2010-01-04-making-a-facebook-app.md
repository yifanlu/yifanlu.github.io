Little to report right now, but basically I've started working on a Facebook app to improve my CSS and Javascript/AJAX skills. Right now, it's still in the early stages and I have nothing to show yet, but I just have to say it looks pretty awesome and clean (like part of Facebook). Smooth ajax transactions, clean UI, and extreme ease of use are my goals. More to report later.
