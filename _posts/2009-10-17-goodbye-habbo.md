I love Habbo and I love retros, but again, it was always "legal unless you got caught". Well, I got caught, and it wasn't fun. My advice (although I doubt anyone would take it) is to stop also BEFORE you get caught. Don't think "ah, there's 1000 other retros, nobody is going to bother about me". Making retros was a great experience for me and I learned alot from it, but I guess it's best for myself if I stop. I'll move to coding more legal stuff. Maybe a hotel from scratch (client,server,site), or maybe I'll start making iPhone apps. I don't know. Retros have been sucking my time away anyways, so, although it was sad, it is a load off of me now.

So now, all my projects related to Habbo and retros are retired and will not be updated any farther. PHPRetro is taken over by 0ni of Otaku, so hopefully it won't die. I hope I can use my time for other projects that are more useful for the general public.

P.S: I'm also retiring two more projects: IPA Manager because it no longer works as Appulo.us was updated to 2.0. Maybe if I have time, I'll recode IPA Manager from scratch with the new Appulo.us API. I'm also retiring iGradebook as it is blocked & it is useless now because the gradebook can be accessed from the iPhone.
