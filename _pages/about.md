I am an aspiring Electrical Engineer, hobbyist developer, and hacker (in the original sense). My main interest is in tearing technology apart and finding out how it works (and breaking it in the process). You may know me for: creating Habbo Hotel private servers (retired and abandoned), Kindle jailbreak and mods, PSXperia (running PSX games on Xperia Play), 3DS hacks, and Vita hacks.
